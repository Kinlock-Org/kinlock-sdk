# Kinlock — Roadmap

> **Mandatory:** every contribution (human or AI agent, any repo) must update this file in the same PR. See [§2](#2-how-this-file-is-maintained-mandatory).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Last updated** | 2026-10-07 (README status banner) |
| **Docs baseline** | v0.3, worldwide scope (`PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `project_structure.md`) |
| **Current phase** | Phase 0 (Foundations) → starting Phase 1 (M0 Validate) |
| **Readiness** | See [§3](#3-progress-snapshot) |

---

## 1. What "100% readiness" means

Kinlock is **100% ready** when **every non-deferred row below is `DONE`**, which means all of the following are true:

1. All **P0 and P1** requirements in `PRD.md` are implemented, tested, and documented.
2. The M0 validation produced a recorded **go** decision (or the roadmap was revised after a pivot).
3. The testnet pilot met its success metrics, or a documented decision explains why we proceed anyway.
4. An **external audit** is complete, and all critical and high findings are fixed and re-verified.
5. A **legal review** has produced a written outcome **for each launch market** and the product's terms and disclosures reflect it.
6. Operations are ready: multisig and key ceremony done, monitoring and alerting live, runbooks written and rehearsed.
7. The contract is deployed to mainnet with **caps**, and a small capped beta is live and stable.
8. Docs are consistent with each other and with the code, and the Wave-ready issue backlog exists.
9. The core is **market-agnostic**: at least two pilot markets (different regions and currencies) ran on the same code, with only registry data and operations differing. Kinlock is worldwide by design and launched market by market.

Deferred and conditional work (Phase 9 and the parking lot in Phase 11) is **not** required for 100%.

> This roadmap is conditional on M0. If the M0 gate says **pivot** or **stop**, revise this file before doing anything else (row `M0-12`).

### Gates

| Gate | Name | Passes when |
|---|---|---|
| **G0** | Foundations | All Phase 0 rows `DONE` |
| **G1** | M0 decision | `M0-11` and `M0-12` `DONE`; decision recorded as go, pivot, or stop |
| **G2** | Contract complete | All Phase 2 rows `DONE`; contract on testnet |
| **G3** | Platform complete | All Phase 3 and Phase 4 rows `DONE` |
| **G4** | Pilot passed | All Phase 5 rows `DONE` |
| **G5** | Pre-mainnet features and freeze | All Phase 6 rows `DONE`; contract code freeze declared |
| **G6** | Hardening complete | All Phase 7 rows `DONE`; formal go/no-go signed (`H-24`) |
| **G7** | Launch | Launch rows `L-01` to `L-05` `DONE`; capped beta live |

Critical path: `G0 → G1 → G2 → G3 → G4 → G5 → G6 → G7`. Phases 3 and 4 can overlap once bindings and the SDK client exist. Book the auditor (`H-03`) **during the pilot**; audit lead time is the most likely schedule risk.

### Rough estimates (assumes 2–3 core engineers plus contributors; revisit after M0)

| Phase | Estimate |
|---|---|
| 0 Foundations | 1 week |
| 1 M0 Validate | 3 weeks |
| 2 Contract + registry | 6–8 weeks |
| 3 SDK + indexer | 4–5 weeks (overlaps) |
| 4 App | 6–8 weeks (overlaps) |
| 5 Testnet pilot | 4–6 weeks |
| 6 Pre-mainnet features | 3–4 weeks |
| 7 Hardening and audit | 8–12 weeks (audit queue dependent) |
| 8 Launch | 2–4 weeks |
| **Total** | **≈ 8–12 months** |

## 2. How this file is maintained (mandatory)

### The rule

**Every pull request, in every Kinlock repo, from any human or agent, must update `ROADMAP.md`.** No exceptions for "small" changes. If the PR changes no rows, it still adds a Changelog entry saying so.

### What to update in every PR

1. **Row statuses** affected by the change (see transitions below).
2. **New rows** for any work you discovered or created. Use the next unused ID in the right phase.
3. **Changelog entry** (§17): date, PR or issue reference, repo, rows touched, one-line summary. Newest first.
4. **Last updated** date at the top.
5. **Progress snapshot** counts in §3 (run `scripts/roadmap-progress` *(intended)*, or update by hand and say so).
6. **Decisions** (§10): move a decision to resolved and link the ADR if your PR settles it.
7. If the PR changes behavior, scope, or a gate, update the relevant docs too (`AGENTS.md` §11).

### Status values and transitions

| Status | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | Not started | Default |
| `IN PROGRESS` | Branch or PR open | Set when you start; note the PR in the Changelog |
| `DONE` | Merged **and** the "Done when" criteria are met **and verified by running the commands** | Never set `DONE` from reading code or a hunch |
| `BLOCKED` | Can't proceed | Must name the blocking row or decision in the "Depends on" cell |
| `DEFERRED` | Intentionally postponed | Needs a reason; link an ADR if it changes a decision |
| `DROPPED` | No longer needed | Needs a reason. **Never delete rows** |

### Rules for editing rows

- **IDs are permanent.** Never reuse or renumber an ID. Add new rows at the end of their phase table.
- **Agents may:** update statuses, tick off their own work, add new rows, and add Changelog entries.
- **Agents must ask a human first** before: changing a row's priority from P0, moving or redefining a gate, editing §1 ("What 100% means"), changing estimates, marking someone else's `BLOCKED` row unblocked, or dropping a P0/P1 row.
- Only mark a row `DONE` if **your PR** completes it, or if you have verified it is complete on `main`.
- If a PR only partially completes a row, leave it `IN PROGRESS` and split off the remainder as a new row.

### Multiple repos, one roadmap

- Each repo has a copy of `ROADMAP.md` **at its root**. This is the one doc that is **not** vendored read-only.
- Each row has an **owning repo** (the Repo column). A PR edits only rows owned by its own repo, plus its own Changelog line and the top-of-file date. Cross-cutting rows (`all`, `org`) are edited in whichever repo's PR completes them.
- Because rows have unique IDs and owners, copies merge cleanly. A maintainer merges them into the canonical copy in the org `.github` repo (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) with `scripts/roadmap-merge` *(intended)*, at least weekly and at every gate.
- On conflict: rebase and keep **both** sides' row changes. Never overwrite another repo's rows.

### Enforcement (intended)

- CI job `roadmap-check` (every repo) fails the PR if `ROADMAP.md` is unchanged, or if the diff lacks a new Changelog entry that references the PR.
- The PR template includes a **Roadmap** section (`AGENTS.md` §7).
- Reviewers reject PRs without a roadmap update.

### Copy-paste checklist for PR authors

```
- [ ] Row statuses updated (and only DONE if verified)
- [ ] New rows added for new work
- [ ] Changelog entry added (date, PR, repo, rows, summary)
- [ ] Last-updated date and progress counts refreshed
- [ ] Decisions section updated if a decision was made
```

## 3. Progress snapshot

Readiness % = `DONE ÷ (all rows − DEFERRED − DROPPED)`. Conditional rows (Phase 9) are `DEFERRED` until their gate opens, then they join the denominator.

## 4. Phase 0 — Foundations

**Goal:** the org, docs, and rules exist so everything after is consistent.
**Exit:** Gate G0.

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Write `PRD.md` v0.2 | org | P0 | DONE | — | Reviewed; hard-questions section present |
| F-02 | Write `ARCHITECTURE.md` v0.2 | org | P0 | DONE | F-01 | Includes data models, stack, ADRs, hard-questions review |

## 5. Phase 1 — M0: Validate and spike

**Goal:** find out whether the product should be built, and how, before building it.
**Exit:** Gate G1 (written go / pivot / stop against `PRD.md` §8.2).
**Why it matters:** the five likeliest failure causes (payee wallets, sender economics, off-ramp, attester trust, legal) are all answered here.

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0-01 | Interview 15 senders across at least 2 candidate markets (script + note template) | org | P0 | TODO | F-08 | Notes stored; themes summarized; willingness to use USDC recorded |
| M0-02 | Interview 5 payees (schools, landlords) in candidate markets, incl. willingness to operate a wallet | org | P0 | TODO | F-08 | At least 3 of 5 answers recorded against the §8.2 trigger |
| M0-03 | Talk to at least 2 attesters (associations, NGOs) about accountability and process | org | P0 | TODO | F-08 | Named willing attesters or a documented "no" |
| M0-04 | Build sender all-in cost model vs incumbent routes | org | P0 | TODO | M0-01 | Spreadsheet with fees at each hop; target cost set (`M0-13`) |
| M0-05 | Off-ramp spike **per candidate market**: identify local-currency anchors and wallet routes (or whether payees can simply hold USDC); test SEP-1/10/24 on testnet; record assets, minimums, fees | org | P0 | TODO | — | Table of viable routes or a documented "none" |
| M0-06 | Payee usability test: onboard 3–5 payees on testnet using the attester checklist | org | P0 | TODO | M0-02 | Task completion rates and pain points recorded |
| M0-07 | Counsel intro call; written scoping of legal questions **per candidate market** (stablecoin acceptance by domestic payees, money transmission, sanctions and restricted jurisdictions, data protection including where senders live, terms) | org | P0 | TODO | — | Counsel engaged; question list and timeline agreed |
| M0-08 | Verify network facts: max entry TTL, RPC event retention, SAC/trustline failure behavior, USDC issuer flags (freeze, authorization, clawback) | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | — | Findings written; `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` confirmed or changed via ADR |
| M0-09 | Research archive/backfill options for receipt verification (tier 3) and indexer gap recovery | sdk | P0 | TODO | M0-08 | Option chosen and costed; ADR drafted |
| M0-10 | Review Drips Wave rules: application limits, KYC, issue-sizing guidelines | org | P1 | TODO | — | Short note; Wave plan (`W-01`) adjusted |
| M0-11 | Write M0 findings report and go / pivot / stop decision against `PRD.md` §8.2 | org | P0 | TODO | M0-01..M0-09 | Report committed; decision recorded in §10 |
| M0-12 | Revise PRD, architecture, essentials, and this roadmap per findings | org | P0 | TODO | M0-11 | Docs updated; changed rows noted in Changelog |

| M0-14 | Competitive note: BarakahPay and other purpose-bound remittance projects | org | P1 | TODO | — | One-page comparison; differentiation confirmed or revised |
| M0-15 | Decide a sustainability/revenue approach (grants, referral, B2B SDK, fee later) | org | P1 | TODO | M0-11 | ADR or PRD §13 answer recorded |
| M0-16 | Choose pilot market(s) and write market-selection criteria (legal feasibility, attester supply, cash-out route, rate source, sender demand). Candidate: Nigeria plus at least one market in a different region and currency | org | P0 | TODO | M0-01, M0-02, M0-03 | Markets chosen and recorded (`DEC-19`) |
| M0-17 | Define the supported-countries policy and restricted-jurisdiction approach with counsel (who decides, criteria, how the list changes) | org | P0 | TODO | M0-07 | Policy written; `DEC-20` resolved |

---

## 6. Phase 2 — M1: Contract and registry

**Goal:** a complete, tested single contract on testnet, and the public registry.
**Exit:** Gate G2.
**Rule:** contract changes are **ask-first** and `security-sensitive` (see `AGENTS.md` §2).

### 6.1 `kinlock-contracts`

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1-01 | Scaffold workspace: Cargo workspace, `rust-toolchain.toml`, empty modules, CI (fmt, clippy, test, build), `localnet.sh` | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | G1 | CI green on empty skeleton; one-command local network |
| M1-02 | Implement `constants.rs`, `types.rs`, `errors.rs`, `events.rs`, `storage.rs` | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M1-01 | Match `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4; enums append-only; events carry `schema_version` |
| M1-03 | Admin functions: `init`, attester add/remove, token add/remove, `set_paused_new_locks`, `set_caps`, `upgrade` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-02 | Auth tested; pause blocks only `create_lock` |
| M1-04 | Registry: `register_payee`, `set_status`, `update_payout` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-02 | Status transitions enforced; payout update affects new locks only |
| M1-05 | Vault: `create_lock` with all validations (token, payee Active, min/max, ≤12 tranches, `unlock_at ≤ expires_at`, max duration, `sender ≠ payout`, caps) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-04 | Each validation has a failing test |
| M1-06 | Vault: `release` (payee only; `unlock_at ≤ now < expires_at`; state before transfer) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | Boundary tests pass |
| M1-07 | Vault: `refund` (expired, Revoked, Suspended past grace) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | All three paths and rejections tested |
| M1-08 | Vault: `decline` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | Returns only remainder; payee-only |
| M1-09 | `bump_lock` and TTL policy on create and on terminal states | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M1-05, M0-08 | TTL ≥ `expires_at + TTL_GRACE`; permissionless bump tested |
| M1-10 | `total_locked` bookkeeping and cap enforcement | contracts | P1 | DONE | M1-05 | Invariant 9 holds under property tests |
| M1-11 | Unit tests for every entry point (success and each failure) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-03..M1-09 | Coverage of every error variant |
| M1-12 | Explicit-auth tests (not only `mock_all_auths`) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-11 | Every privileged function asserts `env.auths()` |
| M1-13 | Boundary tests: `now == unlock_at`, `expires_at - 1`, `expires_at` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-06, M1-07 | Pass |
| M1-14 | Property tests for invariants 1–10 | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-11 | `proptest` sequences green over many runs |
| M1-15 | Integration tests: C-address sender and payee, missing/unauthorized trustline, partial release then refund/decline, allowlist removal with open locks | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-11 | Pass on local network |
| M1-16 | Budget tests with `soroban-budget-assert`; compare local estimates to testnet simulation | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-11 | Budgets recorded; divergence measured and documented |
| M1-17 | `deploy.sh` (testnet default, mainnet guarded), `deployments/testnet.json`, generated `DEPLOYMENTS.md` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-11 | Deploys to testnet; mainnet requires flag and confirmation |
| M1-18 | Generate TS bindings and publish pipeline | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-17, F-11 | Package published on tag; SDK can consume |
| M1-19 | Deploy to testnet with a test multisig admin; add test attesters and testnet USDC | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-17 | Contract ID recorded in `DEPLOYMENTS.md` |
| M1-20 | Upgrade/migration test against a snapshot of testnet state | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-19 | Invariants hold after upgrade |
| M1-21 | Contract `README`, `SECURITY.md`, and threat-model doc linked to invariants | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-14 | Reviewer can map each threat to a control |
| M1-22 | Internal review using the `CLAUDE.md` contract checklist; fix findings | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-16 | Checklist completed with evidence |
| M1-23 | Decide optional `refund_to` (ADR) | contracts | P2 | TODO | M1-05 | ADR accepted or declined |
| M1-30 | Source `soroban-budget-assert` (not published on crates.io) or choose an alternative for budget tests | contracts | P0 | TODO | — | Crate usable from CI; `M1-16` can start |
| M1-31 | Finish M1-03/M1-04 "Done when" once locks exist: tests that pause and token removal block only `create_lock`, and that `update_payout` leaves existing locks' payout unchanged | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | Tests pass; M1-03 and M1-04 can be marked `DONE` |
| M1-32 | Upgrade auth and success test with a real uploaded WASM (an unknown hash also fails, so today's test can't isolate auth) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-17 | Upgrade signed by admin succeeds and asserts `env.auths()`; intruder-signed upgrade fails |
| M1-33 | Reconcile `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` (180 days) with the network max entry TTL: testnet is 3,110,400 ledgers (~180 days at 5 s), so lock + 30-day grace caps expiry at ~150 days today. Set tests to the real max TTL | contracts | P0 | DONE | DEC-07 | Constant and tests match the network; ADR updated |
| M1-34 | Decide `bump_lock` behavior when the full TTL no longer fits (clamp vs error) and after `expires_at + TTL_GRACE`; decide whether to convert seconds to ledgers more conservatively than 5 s | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-33 | Decision recorded; tests cover it |
| M1-35 | Spec decisions from the vault review: tranches with `unlock_at == expires_at` can never be released; suspend/re-activate toggling restarts the sender's refund grace | contracts | P1 | TODO | — | ADR accepted; code and tests follow it |
| M1-36 | Failed token transfers surface the token's error code, which collides with Kinlock codes (SAC code 10 decodes as `PayeeAlreadyExists`); decide on a dedicated error or document it for the SDK | contracts | P1 | TODO | — | Decision recorded; SDK handles it |

### 6.2 `kinlock-registry`

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1-24 | Scaffold registry: schema, `hash`, `validate` scripts, CI | registry | P0 | IN PROGRESS | G1 | CI validates schema and canonical formatting |
| M1-25 | `check-onchain` script and `onchain-match` workflow | registry | P0 | TODO | M1-19, M1-24 | Detects hash mismatch against testnet |
| M1-26 | Write `ATTESTER_CHECKLIST.md` and a script for trustline, XLM float, test release | registry | P0 | TODO | M0-06 | Checklist runs end to end on testnet |
| M1-27 | Add testnet fixture payees | registry | P0 | TODO | M1-24 | At least 3 examples across at least 2 countries, no personal data |
| M1-28 | `CODEOWNERS` for attesters | registry | P0 | TODO | F-12 | Attester review enforced |
| M1-29 | Registry: add `country` (ISO 3166-1), `local_currency` (ISO 4217), per-country directories, `supported-countries.json`, `attesters/<handle>.json`, and CI rules (supported country, attester scope, directory match, unique slug) | registry | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M0-16, M1-24 | Each rule has a failing-case test; fixtures cover at least 2 countries |

| M2-13 | Join payee display data from the registry repo | sdk | P0 | DONE | M1-25 | Payees show name, city, attester |
| M2-14 | Indexer tests: fixture replay, idempotency, cursor recovery, mixed versions | sdk | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M2-10 | Replay twice yields identical DB |
| M2-15 | Lag alerting and health metric | sdk | P1 | TODO | M2-12 | Alert fires in a simulated lag test |
| M2-16 | Implement tier-3 verification and backfill per `M0-09` decision | sdk | P1 | TODO | M0-09, M2-06 | Old receipts verify; backfill fills a deliberate gap |
| M2-17 | SDK docs and API reference; publish testnet package versions | sdk | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M2-07 | Published; docs match exports |
| M2-18 | Indexer container, testnet deployment, managed Postgres, daily backups | sdk | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M2-14 | Running on testnet; restore tested once |
| M2-19 | Indexer and list API: store and filter payees by `country` and `local_currency` (display and filter only) | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-13, M1-29 | `/payees?country=` works; no country logic elsewhere |

## 8. Phase 4 — M3: App

**Goal:** the full payee, sender, attester, and receipt experience on testnet.
**Exit:** completes Gate G3.

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 14. Phase 9 — Conditional: `kinlock-ramp`

**Condition:** only if the M0 anchor spike (`M0-05`) found a viable route **and** the decision allows it. Until then these rows are `DEFERRED` and excluded from readiness.

## 17. Changelog

Newest first. One entry per PR. Required for every contribution (see §2).

| Date | PR / ref | Repo | Rows touched | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/readme-status-banner` | sdk | no row changes | README said "scaffold... features are not built," which is stale (client, preflight, and receipts are implemented and released as v0.3.0). Corrected the status banner to match current progress; supports org-level `W-01` Wave-readiness |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-getpayee | sdk | no row changes | `getPayee` chain read (ADR-0030) for the sender lock page's refund rule; `@kinlock/sdk` 0.3.0 (release via tag `sdk-v0.3.0` after merge). Verified on testnet |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk test/sdk-localnet | sdk | M2-02 DONE | SDK client verified on the local quickstart network (fresh contract, local USDC, one payee: preflight, create, read, release, refused early refund, decline) and again on testnet; full refund verified on testnet (lock 4). Smoke script renamed `scripts/smoke.mjs` and parameterized for local or testnet |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk chore/sdk-0.2.0 | sdk | M2-17 IN PROGRESS (unchanged) | `@kinlock/sdk` 0.2.0: first release with the contract client, preflight and receipt verification (0.1.0 had them as stubs); signatures per ADR-0027..0029. Released via tag `sdk-v0.2.0` after merge |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-receipts | sdk | M2-06 DONE | SDK `verifyReceipt` (ADR-0029): tier 1 from RPC events (exact event, Kinlock contract, successful call, known schema version), tier 2 confirmed with `get_lock` after the indexer event lookup; reasons verified / not_found / mismatch / unverifiable. Real testnet release, decline and refund receipts verified; tampered references rejected |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-event-lookup | sdk | M2-06 IN PROGRESS | List API `GET /events/:txHash/:eventIndex`: which lock and tranche a receipt refers to, as a lookup aid for tier-2 receipt verification (proof stays on chain). Started while M2-02 is IN PROGRESS (local-network run pending), with owner approval |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-preflight | sdk | M2-05 DONE | SDK `preflight` (ADR-0028): sender balance, payee Active and payout trustline from chain (block); recent payout change and duplicate reference from the indexer (warn); `unknown` when a check can't complete. Unit test per check; testnet run with the live indexer passed all five |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-preflight-filters | sdk | M2-05 IN PROGRESS | List API filters for preflight: `GET /locks?payee_id=&ref_hash=` (duplicate reference, uses the existing (payee_id, ref_hash) index) and `GET /payees?payee_id=` (recent payout change) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-client | sdk | M2-02 IN PROGRESS | SDK client over `@kinlock/contract` 0.1.0 (GitHub Release): `createLock`, `release`, `refund`, `decline` (build, simulate, wallet signs, submit) and chain-only `getLock`, with config and signer parameters (ADR-0027). Verified on testnet (create, read, release, refused early refund, decline); local-network run not done (no Docker on the dev machine) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk chore/sdk-github-release | sdk | M2-17 IN PROGRESS (unchanged), DEC-03 amended | `publish` workflow attaches the packed `@kinlock/sdk` tarball to a GitHub Release on `sdk-vX.Y.Z` (ADR-0026) instead of publishing to npm; no publish secret; ADR-0026 synced |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk docs/indexer-testnet-deployed | sdk | M2-18 IN PROGRESS (unchanged) | Indexer live on Railway testnet (https://indexer-production-705a.up.railway.app): caught up, registry join working, refund of lock 2 indexed within seconds. Postgres PITR enabled and a point-in-time restore into a new service succeeded; still open: daily schedule refused on the current plan, and the restored data not yet compared against live |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk test/indexer-real-refund-fixture | sdk | no row changes | Indexer fixtures: add the real testnet `refunded` event for lock 2 (tx 7316fe69…) and replace the synthetic refund in the tests; replay now ends with lock 2 Refunded/Expired |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-deploy | sdk | M2-18 IN PROGRESS | Indexer container (Dockerfile, registry clone at start, migrations before start), `railway.json`, CI job that builds the image and applies migrations against Postgres, Railway runbook with backup and restore-test steps. Not yet deployed: needs the Railway project and variables |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-registry-join | sdk | M2-13 DONE, M2-19 DONE | Registry join: payee name, city, country, local currency and attester handle come from a registry checkout (`REGISTRY_DIR`), shown only when the file is hash-bound to the on-chain registration (payee_id = sha256(slug), meta_hash = sha256(canonical file)); attester handle only when its address matches on-chain; `/payees?country=` filters on joined data; migration 0001 adds `payees.attester_handle` |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-list-api | sdk | M2-12 DONE | List API: `/locks` (sender, payee, state filters; paging), `/locks/:id` with tranches, `/payees` (category, country, text filters; paging), `/health` with ledger lag (503 when lagging or tip unknown); every response labeled `source: "indexer"` with the ledger it reflects; typed request/response contract in `api/schemas.ts`. Started while M2-10 is IN PROGRESS (only its mixed-version test remains), with owner approval |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-ingest | sdk | M2-08 DONE, M2-09 DONE, M2-10 IN PROGRESS, M2-11 DONE, M2-14 IN PROGRESS | Indexer core: RPC client with failover and Zod checks, cursor-based ingest that commits events, effects and cursor in one transaction and stops on gaps or unknown events, handlers for all 7 events (schema_version 1), initial migration, PGlite tests replaying 11 recorded testnet events. Mixed-version fixtures wait for a second schema_version |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/sdk-publish` | sdk | IN PROGRESS: M2-17 | `@kinlock/sdk` 0.1.0 made publishable (exports map, `dist/` only, public access) and a tag-triggered publish workflow (`sdk-vX.Y.Z`, checks + npm provenance). Verified by installing the packed tarball into a blank project and calling it. Not yet published: waits on `NPM_TOKEN` (F-11) |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/sdk-public-api` | sdk | no row changes | Public API gains `toBaseUnits`, `fromBaseUnits`, `generateSalt`, `computeRefHash`, `buildRequestLink`, `parseRequestLink` (owner-approved, ADR-0025); the pinned export test now lists 15 functions. AGENTS.md and docs synced |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/sdk-format-hash-links` | sdk | DONE: M2-03, M2-04, M2-07 | Exact amount conversion (never rounds); `ref_hash` = SHA-256(UTF-8(NFC-trimmed reference) ‖ 16 random salt bytes) (ADR-0024); claim links carry reference and salt only in the URL fragment; request-link helpers built but not exported (public API list, F-19). 49 tests incl. an independent hash check and a no-logging test; 4 mutation checks caught |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/license-and-publishing` | org | DONE: F-10. IN PROGRESS: F-11. DEC-02, DEC-03 resolved | Apache-2.0 for every repo (ADR-0022, `LICENSE` + template); TypeScript packages publish to npm under `@kinlock` from CI on tag (ADR-0023). F-11 waits on an owner creating the npm org and the `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Canonical roadmap re-merged from all repos (picks up M2-01, M3-01) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/ts-tooling` | sdk | DONE: M2-01. DEC-22, DEC-23 resolved (ADR-0021) | Biome (lint + format), Vitest, and tsx added; CI now runs lint, typecheck, test, and build. Tests pin the SDK's public API to the approved list and the contract's enum order, and check the indexer refuses bad config |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/roadmap-sync` (lockfile) | sdk | no row changes (M2-01 stays IN PROGRESS: lint and test tooling pending DEC-22) | Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` for the dependency versions approved by the owner on 2026-10-06, so CI's frozen install works; typecheck and build pass |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/ts-tooling` | app | DONE: M3-01. DEC-22, DEC-23 resolved (ADR-0021) | Biome (lint + format) and Vitest added; CI now runs lint, typecheck, test, and build. Tests keep the receipt wording exactly "Payment to verified payee", ban overclaiming wording, and check every message key resolves. M3-23 stays IN PROGRESS (inline-string lint and multi-locale formatting tests) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/roadmap-sync` (lockfile) | app | no row changes (M3-01 stays IN PROGRESS: lint and test tooling pending DEC-22) | Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` for the dependency versions approved by the owner on 2026-10-06, so CI's frozen install works; typecheck and build pass |
| 2026-10-06 | `docs/adr-ts-tooling` | org | DEC-22, DEC-23 resolved (no row changes) | ADR-0021: Biome, Vitest, tsx, Ajv + ajv-formats; the app keeps its built-in i18n helper |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/roadmap-merge` | org | DONE: F-08, F-14, F-15, F-17, W-03 | Added `scripts/roadmap-merge` (three-way merge against the last merged copy; conflicts reported, never guessed) and merged every repo's ROADMAP.md into the canonical copy, then synced it to all repos. Verified: org exists with an owner; `docs-in-sync` and `roadmap-check` fail and pass correctly; templates and the CONTRIBUTING rule are in every repo. F-09 stays IN PROGRESS (code of conduct is still a draft) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/testnet-multisig-deploy` | contracts | DONE: M1-19 | Testnet contract `CCSHDQFRYFC3AHV5NE6ULQW6X2CMG5RPANBORDXJGSUD6UKECASJQBRI` with a 2-of-3 multisig admin (verified: one signature rejected `TxBadAuth`, two accepted), test attester added, Circle testnet USDC allowlisted. Adds `scripts/multisig-invoke.sh` and `deployments/testnet-setup.md`; vendored docs resynced (ADR-0020). Supersedes the single-key contract `CDIPDHSA…TLYL` |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/deploy-script` | contracts | DONE: M1-17 | `scripts/deploy.sh` (testnet/local, guarded mainnet, dry run, uploaded-hash check) and `scripts/gen-deployments-md.sh`. Deployed to testnet: `CDIPDHSAKP2MNANLYV6VRWVTWFJH3PQRHBRDBVMYNMRYKSR66JVPTLYL`, single-key admin `kinlock-testnet-deployer` (multisig admin, attesters, and testnet USDC remain M1-19) |
| 2026-10-06 | `test/close-m1-11-m1-12` | contracts | DONE: M1-11, M1-12, M1-32 | Removed never-returned errors `AlreadyInitialized` (1) and `TrancheSumMismatch` (27), codes retired; every remaining error variant is now covered by a test. Upgrade tested with the real compiled WASM (admin auth asserted, state survives, intruder fails). CI installs stellar-cli 27.0.0 (checksum-verified) and builds the WASM before clippy and tests |
| 2026-10-06 | `test/property-invariants` | contracts | DONE: M1-14, M1-10 | Property tests for invariants 1–10: random sequences (create, release, refund, decline, status and payout changes, time jumps and exact boundaries, pause, allowlist and roster changes, frozen accounts) check every invariant after every step, and that release/refund/decline succeed exactly when the spec allows. Green over 512 cases; catches 13–14 of 14 injected vault bugs per 64-case run. Started before M1-11 was DONE, at the owner's request |
| 2026-10-05 | `fix/max-lock-duration` | contracts | DONE: M1-33. DEC-07 resolved | `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` = 149 days: testnet `max_entry_ttl` is 3,110,400 ledgers and a contract can extend to one ledger less, so 150 + 30-day grace doesn't fit. Tests now run with the real network limit |
| 2026-10-05 | `feat/vault` | contracts | DONE: M1-03, M1-04, M1-05, M1-06, M1-07, M1-08, M1-13, M1-31. IN PROGRESS: M1-09, M1-10, M1-11, M0-08. Added: M1-33, M1-34, M1-35, M1-36 | Vault: `create_lock`, `release`, `refund`, `decline`, `bump_lock`, `get_lock`; lock and payee TTL kept to `expires_at + TTL_GRACE` (`LockTtlTooLong` otherwise); `InvalidPayout`; `set_caps` sanity; storage version. 103 tests; 19 mutation checks caught; independent review: no critical/high. Testnet `max_entry_ttl` read as 3,110,400 ledgers (M0-08, M1-33). Vendored `docs/adr/` resynced with ADR-0018 and ADR-0019 |
| 2026-10-05 | `feat/admin-registry` | contracts | IN PROGRESS: M1-03, M1-04, M1-12 (M1-02 stays IN PROGRESS). Added: M1-31, M1-32 | Admin functions (constructor replaces `init`), payee registry (`register_payee`, `set_status`, `update_payout`, `get_payee`), TTL extension for long-lived entries, new errors `InvalidCap`, `PayoutUnchanged`, `PayeeRevoked`; 42 unit, auth, event, and TTL tests; independent review findings addressed. Started ahead of G1 at the owner's request |
| 2026-10-05 | `docs/adr-vault` | org | DEC-07 resolved (no row changes) | ADR-0020: vault validation and storage-lifetime rules (LockTtlTooLong, InvalidPayout, set_caps sanity, storage version); `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` = 149 days in ARCHITECTURE, ESSENTIALS, and PRD |
| 2026-10-05 | `docs/adr-admin-registry` | org | no row changes | ADR-0018 (constructor initialization, explicit caller parameters) and ADR-0019 (removed attesters lose payee powers), recording decisions approved for `kinlock-contracts` `feat/admin-registry`. Doc text updates remain under F-19 |
| 2026-10-05 | scaffold (requested by owner; branch `chore/scaffold` in each repo, uncommitted) | all | IN PROGRESS: F-09, F-14, F-15, F-17, W-03, M1-01, M1-02, M1-24, M1-29, M2-01, M2-11, M3-01, M3-23. Added: F-19, M1-30, DEC-22, DEC-23 | Scaffolded org `.github` (docs, 16 ADRs + proposed ADR-0017, templates, `sync-docs.sh`, `roadmap-progress`) and the contracts, registry, sdk, and app repos with data models and stubs. Done ahead of G1 at the owner's request. `kinlock-ramp` left untouched (conditional). Counts refreshed with `scripts/roadmap-progress` |
| 2026-10-05 | scope change (requested by owner) | org | Edited: M0-01, M0-02, M0-05, M0-07, M1-27, M3-06, M3-16, H-11, D-03, D-14, DEC-10, DEC-11, §1 items 5 and 9. Added: M0-16, M0-17, M1-29, M2-19, M3-23, M3-24, H-25, H-26, P-07, L-08, D-16, DEC-19..21 | Product generalized from "abroad to Nigeria" to worldwide (market-by-market launch). Docs bumped to v0.3; country-agnostic-core rule added to `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md`. §1 edited with the owner's approval |
| 2026-10-05 | initial | org | F-01..F-07 | Roadmap created; docs v0.2 baseline recorded; update rule added to `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `project_structure.md`, `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` |
