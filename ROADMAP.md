# Kinlock — Roadmap

> **Mandatory:** every contribution (human or AI agent, any repo) must update this file in the same PR. See [§2](#2-how-this-file-is-maintained-mandatory).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Last updated** | 2026-10-08 (W-05 resolved; 17 Wave issues seeded with seven new rows; issue format proofed against Drips' maintainer guide; the three pre-format issues triaged — app #16 re-emitted, app #15 and registry #7 closed as superseded; repo-side Changelog lines unioned back into canonical by `scripts/roadmap-merge`; that merge's ADR-link normalization anchored so quoted prose cannot be rewritten) |
| **Docs baseline** | v0.3, worldwide scope (`PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `project_structure.md`) |
| **Current phase** | Phase 0 (Foundations) → starting Phase 1 (M0 Validate) |
| **Readiness** | See [§3](#3-progress-snapshot) |

## 1. What "100% readiness" means

Kinlock is **100% ready** when **every non-deferred row below is `DONE`**, which means all of the following are true:

1. All **P0 and P1** requirements in `PRD.md` are implemented, tested, and documented.
2. The M0 validation produced a recorded **go** decision (or the roadmap was revised after a pivot).
3. The testnet pilot met its success metrics, or a documented decision explains why we proceed anyway.
4. An **external audit** is complete, and all critical and high findings are fixed and re-verified.
5. A **legal review** has produced a written outcome **for each launch market** and the product's terms and disclosures reflect it.
6. Operations are ready: multisig and key ceremony done, monitoring and alerting live, runbooks written and rehearsed.
7. The contract is deployed to mainnet with **caps**, and a small capped beta is live and stable.
8. Docs are consistent with each other and with the code, and the Wave-ready issue backlog exists.
9. The core is **market-agnostic**: at least two pilot markets (different regions and currencies) ran on the same code, with only registry data and operations differing. Kinlock is worldwide by design and launched market by market.

Deferred and conditional work (Phase 9 and the parking lot in Phase 11) is **not** required for 100%.

> This roadmap is conditional on M0. If the M0 gate says **pivot** or **stop**, revise this file before doing anything else (row `M0-12`).

### Gates

| Gate | Name | Passes when |
|---|---|---|
| **G0** | Foundations | All Phase 0 rows `DONE` |
| **G1** | M0 decision | `M0-11` and `M0-12` `DONE`; decision recorded as go, pivot, or stop |
| **G2** | Contract complete | All Phase 2 rows `DONE`; contract on testnet |
| **G3** | Platform complete | All Phase 3 and Phase 4 rows `DONE` |
| **G4** | Pilot passed | All Phase 5 rows `DONE` |
| **G5** | Pre-mainnet features and freeze | All Phase 6 rows `DONE`; contract code freeze declared |
| **G6** | Hardening complete | All Phase 7 rows `DONE`; formal go/no-go signed (`H-24`) |
| **G7** | Launch | Launch rows `L-01` to `L-05` `DONE`; capped beta live |

Critical path: `G0 → G1 → G2 → G3 → G4 → G5 → G6 → G7`. Phases 3 and 4 can overlap once bindings and the SDK client exist. Book the auditor (`H-03`) **during the pilot**; audit lead time is the most likely schedule risk.

### Rough estimates (assumes 2–3 core engineers plus contributors; revisit after M0)

| Phase | Estimate |
|---|---|
| 0 Foundations | 1 week |
| 1 M0 Validate | 3 weeks |
| 2 Contract + registry | 6–8 weeks |
| 3 SDK + indexer | 4–5 weeks (overlaps) |
| 4 App | 6–8 weeks (overlaps) |
| 5 Testnet pilot | 4–6 weeks |
| 6 Pre-mainnet features | 3–4 weeks |
| 7 Hardening and audit | 8–12 weeks (audit queue dependent) |
| 8 Launch | 2–4 weeks |
| **Total** | **≈ 8–12 months** |

## 2. How this file is maintained (mandatory)

### The rule

**Every pull request, in every Kinlock repo, from any human or agent, must update `ROADMAP.md`.** No exceptions for "small" changes. If the PR changes no rows, it still adds a Changelog entry saying so.

### What to update in every PR

1. **Row statuses** affected by the change (see transitions below).
2. **New rows** for any work you discovered or created. Use the next unused ID in the right phase.
3. **Changelog entry** (§17): date, PR or issue reference, repo, rows touched, one-line summary. Newest first.
4. **Last updated** date at the top.
5. **Progress snapshot** counts in §3 (run `scripts/roadmap-progress` *(intended)*, or update by hand and say so).
6. **Decisions** (§10): move a decision to resolved and link the ADR if your PR settles it.
7. If the PR changes behavior, scope, or a gate, update the relevant docs too (`AGENTS.md` §11).

### Status values and transitions

| Status | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | Not started | Default |
| `IN PROGRESS` | Branch or PR open | Set when you start; note the PR in the Changelog |
| `DONE` | Merged **and** the "Done when" criteria are met **and verified by running the commands** | Never set `DONE` from reading code or a hunch |
| `BLOCKED` | Can't proceed | Must name the blocking row or decision in the "Depends on" cell |
| `DEFERRED` | Intentionally postponed | Needs a reason; link an ADR if it changes a decision |
| `DROPPED` | No longer needed | Needs a reason. **Never delete rows** |

### Rules for editing rows

- **IDs are permanent.** Never reuse or renumber an ID. Add new rows at the end of their phase table.
- **Agents may:** update statuses, tick off their own work, add new rows, and add Changelog entries.
- **Agents must ask a human first** before: changing a row's priority from P0, moving or redefining a gate, editing §1 ("What 100% means"), changing estimates, marking someone else's `BLOCKED` row unblocked, or dropping a P0/P1 row.
- Only mark a row `DONE` if **your PR** completes it, or if you have verified it is complete on `main`.
- If a PR only partially completes a row, leave it `IN PROGRESS` and split off the remainder as a new row.

### Multiple repos, one roadmap

- Each repo has a copy of `ROADMAP.md` **at its root**. This is the one doc that is **not** vendored read-only.
- Each row has an **owning repo** (the Repo column). A PR edits only rows owned by its own repo, plus its own Changelog line and the top-of-file date. Cross-cutting rows (`all`, `org`) are edited in whichever repo's PR completes them.
- Because rows have unique IDs and owners, copies merge cleanly. A maintainer merges them into the canonical copy in the org `.github` repo (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) with `scripts/roadmap-merge` *(intended)*, at least weekly and at every gate.
- On conflict: rebase and keep **both** sides' row changes. Never overwrite another repo's rows.

### Enforcement (intended)

- CI job `roadmap-check` (every repo) fails the PR if `ROADMAP.md` is unchanged, or if the diff lacks a new Changelog entry that references the PR.
- The PR template includes a **Roadmap** section (`AGENTS.md` §7).
- Reviewers reject PRs without a roadmap update.

### Copy-paste checklist for PR authors

```
- [ ] Row statuses updated (and only DONE if verified)
- [ ] New rows added for new work
- [ ] Changelog entry added (date, PR, repo, rows, summary)
- [ ] Last-updated date and progress counts refreshed
- [ ] Decisions section updated if a decision was made
```

## 3. Progress snapshot

Readiness % = `DONE ÷ (all rows − DEFERRED − DROPPED)`. Conditional rows (Phase 9) are `DEFERRED` until their gate opens, then they join the denominator.

## 4. Phase 0 — Foundations

**Goal:** the org, docs, and rules exist so everything after is consistent.
**Exit:** Gate G0.

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Write `PRD.md` v0.2 | org | P0 | DONE | — | Reviewed; hard-questions section present |
| F-02 | Write `ARCHITECTURE.md` v0.2 | org | P0 | DONE | F-01 | Includes data models, stack, ADRs, hard-questions review |

| F-08 | Confirm org name availability and create the GitHub org (`kinlock` or backup) | org | P0 | DONE | — | Org exists; owners set |
| F-09 | Create org `.github` repo: profile README, CoC, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT, canonical `docs/`, `templates/` | org | P0 | IN PROGRESS | F-08 | Repo public; docs and templates committed |
| F-10 | Decide license (org-wide) | org | P0 | DONE | F-08 | ADR written; `LICENSE` template ready |
| F-11 | Decide package names and distribution | org | P0 | DONE | F-08 | Package names chosen; release process documented and a release installs (ADR-0026) |
| F-12 | Create GitHub teams: maintainers, contract-reviewers, attesters | org | P0 | DONE | F-08 | Teams exist; handles match `CODEOWNERS` |
| F-13 | Create label set across repos (`security-sensitive`, `good first issue`, `wave`, `area:*`, `blocked:m0`, `deferred`) | org | P0 | DONE | F-08 | Labels applied via script |
| F-14 | Write `scripts/sync-docs` and the `docs-in-sync` CI job | org | P0 | DONE | F-09 | CI fails when a vendored copy drifts |

| F-18 | Cross-doc consistency review after any M0-driven change | org | P1 | TODO | M0-12 | All docs agree; ADR index current |
| F-19 | Reconcile docs with scaffold findings: Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`; contract `tests/` must live in `contracts/kinlock/tests/` (a virtual Cargo workspace root can't hold integration tests); GitHub org is `Kinlock-Org`, not `kinlock`; request-link helpers are not in the SDK public API list; `TrancheInput` type added for `create_lock`; accept ADR-0017 and add it to the ADR indexes | org | P1 | TODO | — | Docs and scaffold agree; ADR-0017 accepted or rejected |

## 5. Phase 1 — M0: Validate and spike

**Goal:** find out whether the product should be built, and how, before building it.
**Exit:** Gate G1 (written go / pivot / stop against `PRD.md` §8.2).
**Why it matters:** the five likeliest failure causes (payee wallets, sender economics, off-ramp, attester trust, legal) are all answered here.

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0-01 | Interview 15 senders across at least 2 candidate markets (script + note template) | org | P0 | IN PROGRESS | F-08 | Notes stored; themes summarized; willingness to use USDC recorded |
| M0-02 | Interview 5 payees (schools, landlords) in candidate markets, incl. willingness to operate a wallet | org | P0 | IN PROGRESS | F-08 | At least 3 of 5 answers recorded against the §8.2 trigger |
| M0-03 | Talk to at least 2 attesters (associations, NGOs) about accountability and process | org | P0 | IN PROGRESS | F-08 | Named willing attesters or a documented "no" |
| M0-04 | Build sender all-in cost model vs incumbent routes | org | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M0-01 | Spreadsheet with fees at each hop; target cost set (`M0-13`) |
| M0-05 | Off-ramp spike **per candidate market**: identify local-currency anchors and wallet routes (or whether payees can simply hold USDC); test SEP-1/10/24 on testnet; record assets, minimums, fees | org | P0 | TODO | — | Table of viable routes or a documented "none" |
| M0-06 | Payee usability test: onboard 3–5 payees on testnet using the attester checklist | org | P0 | TODO | M0-02 | Task completion rates and pain points recorded |
| M0-07 | Counsel intro call; written scoping of legal questions **per candidate market** (stablecoin acceptance by domestic payees, money transmission, sanctions and restricted jurisdictions, data protection including where senders live, terms) | org | P0 | TODO | — | Counsel engaged; question list and timeline agreed |
| M0-08 | Verify network facts: max entry TTL, RPC event retention, SAC/trustline failure behavior, USDC issuer flags (freeze, authorization, clawback) | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | — | Findings written; `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` confirmed or changed via ADR |
| M0-09 | Research archive/backfill options for receipt verification (tier 3) and indexer gap recovery | sdk | P0 | TODO | M0-08 | Option chosen and costed; ADR drafted |
| M0-10 | Review Drips Wave rules: application limits, KYC, issue-sizing guidelines | org | P1 | DONE | — | Short note; Wave plan (`W-01`) adjusted |
| M0-11 | Write M0 findings report and go / pivot / stop decision against `PRD.md` §8.2 | org | P0 | TODO | M0-01..M0-09 | Report committed; decision recorded in §10 |
| M0-12 | Revise PRD, architecture, essentials, and this roadmap per findings | org | P0 | TODO | M0-11 | Docs updated; changed rows noted in Changelog |
| M0-13 | Set sender all-in cost target and pilot metric thresholds | org | P0 | TODO | M0-04 | Numbers recorded in PRD §8.1 |
| M0-14 | Competitive note: BarakahPay and other purpose-bound remittance projects | org | P1 | IN PROGRESS | — | One-page comparison; differentiation confirmed or revised |
| M0-15 | Decide a sustainability/revenue approach (grants, referral, B2B SDK, fee later) | org | P1 | TODO | M0-11 | ADR or PRD §13 answer recorded |
| M0-16 | Choose pilot market(s) and write market-selection criteria (legal feasibility, attester supply, cash-out route, rate source, sender demand). Candidate: Nigeria plus at least one market in a different region and currency | org | P0 | TODO | M0-01, M0-02, M0-03 | Markets chosen and recorded (`DEC-19`) |
| M0-17 | Define the supported-countries policy and restricted-jurisdiction approach with counsel (who decides, criteria, how the list changes) | org | P0 | TODO | M0-07 | Policy written; `DEC-20` resolved |

## 6. Phase 2 — M1: Contract and registry

**Goal:** a complete, tested single contract on testnet, and the public registry.
**Exit:** Gate G2.
**Rule:** contract changes are **ask-first** and `security-sensitive` (see `AGENTS.md` §2).

### 6.1 `kinlock-contracts`

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1-01 | Scaffold workspace: Cargo workspace, `rust-toolchain.toml`, empty modules, CI (fmt, clippy, test, build), `localnet.sh` | contracts | P0 | DONE | G1 | CI green on empty skeleton; one-command local network |
| M1-02 | Implement `constants.rs`, `types.rs`, `errors.rs`, `events.rs`, `storage.rs` | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M1-01 | Match `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4; enums append-only; events carry `schema_version` |
| M1-03 | Admin functions: `init`, attester add/remove, token add/remove, `set_paused_new_locks`, `set_caps`, `upgrade` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-02 | Auth tested; pause blocks only `create_lock` |
| M1-04 | Registry: `register_payee`, `set_status`, `update_payout` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-02 | Status transitions enforced; payout update affects new locks only |
| M1-05 | Vault: `create_lock` with all validations (token, payee Active, min/max, ≤12 tranches, `unlock_at ≤ expires_at`, max duration, `sender ≠ payout`, caps) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-04 | Each validation has a failing test |
| M1-06 | Vault: `release` (payee only; `unlock_at ≤ now < expires_at`; state before transfer) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | Boundary tests pass |
| M1-07 | Vault: `refund` (expired, Revoked, Suspended past grace) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | All three paths and rejections tested |
| M1-08 | Vault: `decline` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | Returns only remainder; payee-only |
| M1-09 | `bump_lock` and TTL policy on create and on terminal states | contracts | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M1-05, M0-08 | TTL ≥ `expires_at + TTL_GRACE`; permissionless bump tested |
| M1-10 | `total_locked` bookkeeping and cap enforcement | contracts | P1 | DONE | M1-05 | Invariant 9 holds under property tests |
| M1-11 | Unit tests for every entry point (success and each failure) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-03..M1-09 | Coverage of every error variant |
| M1-12 | Explicit-auth tests (not only `mock_all_auths`) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-11 | Every privileged function asserts `env.auths()` |
| M1-13 | Boundary tests: `now == unlock_at`, `expires_at - 1`, `expires_at` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-06, M1-07 | Pass |
| M1-14 | Property tests for invariants 1–10 | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-11 | `proptest` sequences green over many runs |
| M1-15 | Integration tests: C-address sender and payee, missing/unauthorized trustline, partial release then refund/decline, allowlist removal with open locks | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-11 | Pass on local network |
| M1-16 | Budget tests with `soroban-budget-assert`; compare local estimates to testnet simulation | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-11 | Budgets recorded; divergence measured and documented |
| M1-17 | `deploy.sh` (testnet default, mainnet guarded), `deployments/testnet.json`, generated `DEPLOYMENTS.md` | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-11 | Deploys to testnet; mainnet requires flag and confirmation |
| M1-18 | Generate TS bindings and publish pipeline | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-17, F-11 | Package published on tag; SDK can consume |
| M1-19 | Deploy to testnet with a test multisig admin; add test attesters and testnet USDC | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-17 | Contract ID recorded in `DEPLOYMENTS.md` |
| M1-20 | Upgrade/migration test against a snapshot of testnet state | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-19 | Invariants hold after upgrade |
| M1-21 | Contract `README`, `SECURITY.md`, and threat-model doc linked to invariants | contracts | P1 | DONE | M1-14 | Reviewer can map each threat to a control |
| M1-22 | Internal review using the `CLAUDE.md` contract checklist; fix findings | contracts | P0 | TODO | M1-16 | Checklist completed with evidence |
| M1-23 | Decide optional `refund_to` (ADR) | contracts | P2 | TODO | M1-05 | ADR accepted or declined |
| M1-30 | Source `soroban-budget-assert` (not published on crates.io) or choose an alternative for budget tests | contracts | P0 | TODO | — | Crate usable from CI; `M1-16` can start |
| M1-31 | Finish M1-03/M1-04 "Done when" once locks exist: tests that pause and token removal block only `create_lock`, and that `update_payout` leaves existing locks' payout unchanged | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-05 | Tests pass; M1-03 and M1-04 can be marked `DONE` |
| M1-32 | Upgrade auth and success test with a real uploaded WASM (an unknown hash also fails, so today's test can't isolate auth) | contracts | P0 | DONE | M1-17 | Upgrade signed by admin succeeds and asserts `env.auths()`; intruder-signed upgrade fails |
| M1-33 | Reconcile `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` (180 days) with the network max entry TTL: testnet is 3,110,400 ledgers (~180 days at 5 s), so lock + 30-day grace caps expiry at ~150 days today. Set tests to the real max TTL | contracts | P0 | DONE | DEC-07 | Constant and tests match the network; ADR updated |
| M1-34 | Decide `bump_lock` behavior when the full TTL no longer fits (clamp vs error) and after `expires_at + TTL_GRACE`; decide whether to convert seconds to ledgers more conservatively than 5 s | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-33 | Decision recorded; tests cover it |
| M1-35 | Spec decisions from the vault review: tranches with `unlock_at == expires_at` can never be released; suspend/re-activate toggling restarts the sender's refund grace | contracts | P1 | TODO | — | ADR accepted; code and tests follow it |
| M1-36 | Failed token transfers surface the token's error code, which collides with Kinlock codes (SAC code 10 decodes as `PayeeAlreadyExists`); decide on a dedicated error or document it for the SDK | contracts | P1 | TODO | — | Decision recorded; SDK handles it |
| M1-37 | Script the local-network setup (identities, local USDC, contract, attester, token, one payee) so anyone can run the SDK smoke test locally | contracts | P1 | DONE | M2-02 | One command on a fresh local network prints the env block; the SDK smoke test passes with it |
| M1-38 | Property harness asserts invariants 5, 6 and 8 directly in `check_invariants`, not only through the operation gates | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-14 | Each has a named assertion; a deliberately weakened gate is caught; `src/` untouched |
| M1-39 | Contract surface reference: `docs/ERRORS.md` (every `#[contracterror]` code) and `docs/EVENTS.md` (all seven events with fields and `schema_version`) | contracts | P1 | TODO | M1-02 | Both pages exist in canonical docs; counts match `errors.rs` and `events.rs`; `sync-docs.sh --check` passes |
| M1-40 | Registry validator boundary-fixture corpus: 0-, 2- and 3-decimal `local_currency`, non-Latin and right-to-left `display_name`, `slug` at its length limit, rejected `payout_address` forms | registry | P1 | TODO | M1-24, M1-27 | Each rule has a fixture that exercises it; rejections asserted by message; at least three countries represented |
| M1-41 | `validate` reports every rule failure in one run instead of stopping at the first | registry | P2 | TODO | M1-40 | A record with three violations lists all three with file, rule id and fix hint; deterministic output; existing cases unedited |

### 6.2 `kinlock-registry`

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1-24 | Scaffold registry: schema, `hash`, `validate` scripts, CI | registry | P0 | DONE | G1 | CI validates schema and canonical formatting |
| M1-25 | `check-onchain` script and `onchain-match` workflow | registry | P0 | DONE | M1-19, M1-24 | Detects hash mismatch against testnet |
| M1-26 | Write `ATTESTER_CHECKLIST.md` and a script for trustline, XLM float, test release | registry | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M0-06 | Checklist runs end to end on testnet |
| M1-27 | Add testnet fixture payees | registry | P0 | DONE | M1-24 | At least 3 examples across at least 2 countries, no personal data |
| M1-28 | `CODEOWNERS` for attesters | registry | P0 | TODO | F-12 | Attester review enforced |
| M1-29 | Registry: add `country` (ISO 3166-1), `local_currency` (ISO 4217), per-country directories, `supported-countries.json`, `attesters/<handle>.json`, and CI rules (supported country, attester scope, directory match, unique slug) | registry | P0 | DONE | M0-16, M1-24 | Each rule has a failing-case test; fixtures cover at least 2 countries |

## 7. Phase 3 — M2: Indexer and SDK

**Goal:** typed client and a reliable event mirror for lists.
**Exit:** part of Gate G3.

| ID | Task | Repo | Pri | Status | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M2-01 | Scaffold `kinlock-sdk`: pnpm workspace, tsconfig, lint, CI, Postgres `docker-compose` | sdk | P0 | DONE | G1 | CI green on skeleton |
| M2-02 | SDK `client`: `createLock`, `release`, `refund`, `decline`, `getLock` (chain reads) | sdk | P0 | DONE | M1-18 | Works against local and testnet |
| M2-03 | SDK `hash` and `links`: `ref_hash`, `buildClaimLink`, `parseClaimLink`, request links | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-02 | Fragment never leaves the client; round-trip tests |
| M2-04 | SDK `format`: bigint ↔ decimal strings; 7-decimal USDC formatting | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-01 | No `number` used for money; edge-case tests |
| M2-05 | SDK `preflight`: balance, payee Active, recent payout change, duplicate `ref_hash`, authorized trustline | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-02 | Each check has a test |
| M2-06 | SDK `receipts`: `verifyReceipt` tiers 1 and 2 | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-02 | Valid and tampered receipts distinguished |
| M2-07 | SDK tests, including a check that nothing derived from the fragment is logged | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-03 | Test fails if fragment data reaches logger |
| M2-08 | Indexer scaffold: Zod config, RPC client with multi-provider failover | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-01 | Failover tested |
| M2-09 | Indexer ingest: poller, persisted cursor, gap detection | sdk | P0 | DONE | M2-08 | Gaps stop ingestion and alert; never skipped silently |
| M2-10 | Indexer handlers per event type and `schema_version` | sdk | P0 | IN PROGRESS | M2-09, M1-02 | Mixed-version fixtures handled |

## 14. Phase 9 — Conditional: `kinlock-ramp`

**Condition:** only if the M0 anchor spike (`M0-05`) found a viable route **and** the decision allows it. Until then these rows are `DEFERRED` and excluded from readiness.

## 17. Changelog

Newest first. One entry per PR. Required for every contribution (see §2).

| Date | PR / ref | Repo | Rows touched | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-08 | `chore/roadmap-copy-back` (#39) | sdk | no row changes | Copy-back run: `ROADMAP.md` replaced with the merged canonical (`.github` main as of #31) in repo-root link form, and §3 recomputed with `scripts/roadmap-progress`. This is the step `roadmap-merge`'s header requires after every merge and that was skipped between 2026-10-06 and 2026-10-08, which is how the seven copies reached 92 divergent statuses. Verified in this checkout: the file equals canonical byte for byte apart from this entry and the ADR link prefix, `W-05` reads `DONE`, the seven Wave rows are present, duplicate row-ID scan is 0. No row, status, priority, dependency or **Done when** was authored in this repo. |
| 2026-10-08 | `fix/roadmap-merge-link-anchor` | org | no row changes | Found while preparing the copy-back. `roadmap-merge`'s read normalization rewrote the docs-rooted ADR link form into the root-relative one on every copy so the two depths compare equal — correct for links, wrong for prose: the union entry above quotes both forms, so reading that line collapsed its own quote and emitted a Changelog entry contradicting itself, in a copy that no longer matched canonical line for line. Fixed by anchoring the replace on the numeric ADR filename that always follows the slash, so only real links are rewritten, and by re-wording the union entry to name the two forms as `docs/adr/` and `adr/` rather than spelling them as link text: **an entry that describes this rewrite must not itself be a string the rewrite can act on.** Verified: the anchored read leaves a quoted form byte-identical where the blanket replace corrupted it; a full `roadmap-merge` over all five copies against `b12d290` exits 0 with **0 lines** differing from canonical, which also confirms the union is complete; the one real link (`ADR-0026`) still normalizes both ways. No row, status, priority, dependency or **Done when** in this diff. |
| 2026-10-08 | `chore/roadmap-changelog-union` | org | no row changes | Second `scripts/roadmap-merge` run now that the Wave-format PRs have merged (`.github` #26 and #27, contracts #31, sdk #38, app #43, registry #18). Three-way against `b12d290`, the revision where all five copies were last identical. The merge's **entire** output is four lines: the repo-side `docs/wave-issue-format` Changelog rows that each repo wrote into its own copy and canonical never saw. No row ID, status, priority, dependency or **Done when** moved — the seven new rows went in byte-identically, and `W-05`'s `TODO` → `DONE` stayed on the `org` row in canonical as §12 requires, so the repo copies' deliberately-untouched `TODO` was not merged back over it. §3 verified unchanged by `roadmap-progress`: 211 rows, 75 `DONE`, 40%. **Not in this PR:** the copy-back. Each repo's `ROADMAP.md` must be rewritten from the merged canonical, with the ADR links rewritten for the repo-root location, so all five copies are byte-identical again — that invariant is what makes `--ancestor` meaningful next time, and it needs four repo PRs that can only be cut after this lands. |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/legacy-issue-triage` | org | no row changes | Worked the three issues left over from the 2026-10-07 seeding, in the proved format, without touching any label. `kinlock-app` #16 (`M3-20`, P0 copy and wording review) re-emitted through the same renderer as the rest of the backlog and judged fresh: `medium` = 150 points, stated in the body. Its evidence is now real rather than asserted — the file holds 293 strings (`lib/i18n/inline-strings.test.ts` proves that is the whole surface), the rule-7 guard blocks exactly two literals (`lib/i18n/messages.test.ts:26-30`) so any synonym of overclaim passes CI, and `pages.request.referenceHint` (`messages/en.json:85`) and `pages.send.referenceHint` (`:112`) make **different privacy promises about the same field**, which is routed to a maintainer as `AGENTS.md` §3 rule 5 territory instead of a contributor's guess. `kinlock-app` #15 closed as superseded: the `M3-17` umbrella is now #38 (contrast, three named call sites with measured ratios) and #39 (skip link, focus, keyboard), with the unowned remainder spelled out in the closing comment. `kinlock-registry` #7 closed as superseded: both things it asked for already exist (`ATTESTER_CHECKLIST.md`, `scripts/check-attester-readiness.ts`), and the row's remaining "runs end to end on testnet" half needs a named attester and a signed testnet transaction, so it cannot be a Wave issue at all — `M1-26` stays `IN PROGRESS`, #17 is the claimable half. Also repaired six citations of a non-existent "§3.5" across published issues (now "hard rule 5"; `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 is the tech stack) and added the three triage rules these cases imply to `docs/wave-issue-format.md`: confirm the deliverable is not already in `main`, re-emit or close-with-a-pointer any pre-format issue, and make every rule reference resolve. The format audit covers 18 issues now, gaps: none. |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/issue-format-proof` | org | no row changes | Proved the issue format and all 17 seeded Wave issues against Drips' maintainer guide (*Creating Meaningful Issues*). Two sections added to the format — **Edge cases and traps** (principle 4: direction without micromanagement) and **How we review** (principle 5: say how the work will be reviewed) — and **Opening the pull request** now requires assignment before starting, `Closes #<issue>`, a commit-subject example and the evidence the PR must carry. **Tier and effort** states the Wave point value (Trivial 100 · Medium 150 · High 200) on every issue, with the cycle's numbers to be re-confirmed on `drips.network/wave/stellar`; the `tier/*` GitHub labels stay Kinlock's bookkeeping, no new labels introduced. `contracts` #27's effort was restated and its tier/points seam disclosed rather than papered over. |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/wave-issue-format` | org | Added: M1-38, M1-39, M1-40, M1-41, M2-20, M2-21, M3-27. Resolved: W-05 | Published `docs/wave-issue-format.md` (one issue format, three tiers mapped to Wave points, exclusion list, triage SLAs) and rewrote `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/wave-task.md` to match. Seeded the Wave backlog: 17 tiered issues across the four repos (contracts #27–#30, sdk #34–#37, app #37–#42, registry #15–#17), each mapped to a roadmap row and confined to the `project_structure.md` §8 safe categories. The seven new rows were inserted byte-identically into all five ROADMAP.md copies so the merge sees no divergence. |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/wave-issue-format` (org side: `.github` #26) | contracts | Added `M1-38`, `M1-39` (this repo); `M1-40`, `M1-41`, `M2-20`, `M2-21`, `M3-27` mirrored for copy parity; `W-05` left `TODO` (org row) | Adopted the single org issue format and seeded the contracts half of the Wave backlog: #27 → `M1-38`, #28 → `M1-15`, #29 → `M1-39`, #30 → `F-18`/`F-19`. The seven rows are byte-identical across all five `ROADMAP.md` copies so `scripts/roadmap-merge` sees no divergence. |

| 2026-10-08 | `chore/roadmap-reconcile` | org | canonical: 43 statuses corrected, rows M1-37 / M3-25 / M3-26 added; each repo copy: 36-52 statuses corrected, rows W-09 / W-10 added | First run of `scripts/roadmap-merge` (F-15) since the copies diverged at c488967 (2026-10-06). Three-way merge against that revision as ancestor: rows owned by a repo taken from that repo's copy, `org` / `all` rows from whichever copy changed them relative to the ancestor. One conflict adjudicated by hand: **F-11** - the canonical copy's reword and `DONE` (bea228e, ADR-0026) supersedes every repo copy's stale `IN PROGRESS`. **DEC-03** differed only in its ADR link prefix (`adr/` under `docs/`, `docs/adr/` at a repo root); `roadmap-merge` now normalizes that on read, so a path difference is never reported as a conflict. Root cause: each copy only ever advanced its own repo's rows, so every copy was stale for every other repo's rows too - 92 divergent statuses across the seven copies. Also corrects PR #25's changelog row, which was dated 2026-10-09 although the merge ran 2026-10-08 UTC. Progress table regenerated with `scripts/roadmap-progress`: **74 of 204 rows DONE, 41% readiness** |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/m3-24-country-agnostic-guard` | app | DONE: M3-24 | `M3-24` is a cross-cutting row ("all"); this PR plus a matching one in `kinlock-sdk` (PR #32 there) together complete it, so both mark it `DONE`. Added `lib/country-agnostic.test.ts`: fails if `nigeria`, `naira`, `ngn`, or `lagos` (case-insensitive, whole-word) appears anywhere under `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, or `messages/`, excluding `*.test.ts`/`*.test.tsx`. Grounded in `AGENTS.md`'s own quick-reference wording ("Don't assume Nigeria or naira in code, tests, fixtures, or copy"), not a general country/currency-word ban, since this app's fixtures and UI deliberately exercise several real markets side by side (`messages/en.json` is included, since "copy" is explicitly in scope per that same rule). `docs/PRD.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` are out of scope, since they legitimately narrate the pre-v0.3 "abroad to Nigeria" history. Runs via the existing `pnpm test` step already in CI, mirroring `lib/i18n/inline-strings.test.ts`'s existing pattern for a different check: no CI workflow changes needed. Verified the guard can actually fail: temporarily added a real violation to `lib/constants.ts`, confirmed it was caught with the exact term and file named, reverted (`git diff` empty), confirmed a clean pass. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (166/166), `pnpm build` all green |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/m3-14-fragment-leak-test` | app | DONE: M3-14 | The security headers, strict CSP, and no-third-party-scripts work was already built (`proxy.ts`, `lib/security/csp.ts`); the row's actual "Done when" (an automated test confirming the claim-link fragment never appears in any network request) didn't exist, and `lib/security/csp.test.ts` only unit-tests the CSP string builder, not real runtime behavior. Added `e2e/claim-fragment-privacy.spec.ts`: loads `/claim/11` (a real, already-existing testnet lock) with a real-shaped fragment, captures every outbound request for the page's lifetime (URL, body, headers), and fails if the reference or salt appears anywhere. Configured `playwright.config.ts` with a `webServer` (`pnpm build && pnpm start`, since `/claim/*`'s CSP differs between dev and production) and a `baseURL`, neither of which existed before. Verified the test can actually fail, not just trivially pass: temporarily injected a real leak into `useClaim.ts` (a stray `fetch` echoing the reference and salt), confirmed the test caught it with a clear diagnostic, then reverted (`git diff` confirms byte-identical to before) and confirmed a clean pass on the real code. Also caught and fixed two test-design bugs along the way: an invalid (non-`generateSalt()`-shaped) test salt silently made `parseClaimLink` throw before any of the code under test ran, and `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` never resolves on this page (it polls), so switched to a fixed wait. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (108/108), `pnpm build`, and the E2E test itself, run manually multiple times. **Not done here**: wiring this into CI. `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` is marked `DRAFT (ask-first: CI)` and currently just echoes a placeholder; actually running `pnpm e2e` there needs a human to approve editing the workflow file, per `AGENTS.md`'s CI/CD ask-first rule. No new secrets needed (all required env vars are the existing public `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` testnet config) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/m3-06-testnet-verification` | app | M3-06 (status unchanged, `IN PROGRESS`) | Attempted the owner's ask to verify `/send` by driving the live app with a real testnet wallet. Got substantially further than "can't automate a browser extension": `@creit.tech/stellar-wallets-kit`'s Albedo option is web-based (no extension) and exposes "provide secret key directly," reachable via Playwright against the real `kinlock-app.vercel.app/send` all the way to the secret-entry field. Writing the secret into any file or process for that automation was blocked outright by the harness's credential-materialization check, including after the owner pasted it directly into the conversation; did not attempt to work around that. Fell back to proving the layer underneath instead: called the deployed contract's `create_lock` directly via `stellar contract invoke` (using a CLI-keystore identity by name, so no secret was ever materialized by this agent), from a freshly generated, friendbot-funded sender account with a real Circle testnet-USDC trustline and balance (owner completed the faucet's human-verification step). Simulated first, then submitted for real: lock id `11` created on the live testnet contract (tx `0b65ec01b50052bac645242c9d375151c4a2b7517856340504d5b7aa46d2042a`, verifiable on stellar.expert), 2 USDC transferred to the contract, correct payee/payout snapshot. Confirmed the indexer picked it up correctly (`/locks/11` matches the submitted transaction exactly) and that the live app's own `/locks/11` and `/claim/11` pages render it (`200`, real chain data). This proves the contract and SDK path End to end on testnet, the thing `/send`'s own code depends on, but does **not** prove `/send`'s own `useSendForm.ts` → wallet-kit → `createLock()` code path specifically, since the actual signing step was bypassed via direct CLI rather than driven through the app. Narrowing what's left for `M3-06`: a human completing the Albedo "provide secret key" step themselves in their own browser against the live site, or a CI-sanctioned signing approach for `M3-19` (still an open, deferred decision) |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/m3-21-indexer-lag-notice` | app | DONE: M3-21 | Audited each of the row's five named states against the actual message keys and error-mapping code (not assumed): **trustline failure** (claim/release side: `claim-logic.ts`'s `CONTRACT_ERRORS` plus `errorTx`'s "can't receive this asset yet" phrasing; send side: `preflight.payout_trustline_authorized.*`, already specific per failure mode), **expired** (`claim.errorExpired`, `lock.refundAvailable.Expired`), **revoked** and **suspended** (`claim.errorPayeeNotActive` via the contract's `PayeeNotActive` error; `preflight.payee_active.revoked`/`.suspended`; `lock.refundAvailable.Revoked`/`.SuspendedTimeout`) were all already clear and, per the SDK's own preflight doc comment, chain-backed where it matters (`payee_active` and `payout_trustline_authorized` are blocking chain checks, never indexer-sourced, so none of this is at risk from indexer lag). **Indexer lag** was the one genuinely missing piece: added `indexerLagging()` to `lib/indexer/index.ts` (reads the indexer's own `/health` status, defaulting to "possibly stale" on any failure so a broken health check can't silently hide a real lag) and a shared `<LagNotice>` component, shown on `/send`, `/request`, and `/payee` when the indexer reports anything other than `ok`. Purely informational, never blocking: every actual money decision already re-reads chain state regardless. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (108/108, 5 new in `lib/indexer/index.test.ts`), `pnpm build`; confirmed against the real indexer (currently healthy, `lagLedgers: 1`, correctly shows no notice) that the three pages still render and list payees correctly with the added parallel health fetch |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/payee-dashboard` | app | DONE: M3-11 | Built `/payee`, replacing its `PageStub`. Connect a wallet; `matchingPayeeIds` (new, `payee-logic.ts`) finds every registered payee this wallet is the payout address for, by matching against the already-fetched indexer payee list (no new chain or indexer call needed for that step). For each match, lists its locks via a new `listLocks(payeeId, state?)` in `lib/indexer/index.ts`, filterable by status (server-side, re-queries the indexer per change) and by one specific payment: pasting a claim link runs the exact same `parseClaimLink` + `computeRefHash` check `/claim/[id]` already uses, entirely client-side (hard rule 5: the reference and salt never leave the browser; only `ref_hash` is ever compared). `listLocks` is callable from the browser too (same-origin, via `next.config.ts`'s existing `/locks` rewrite), unlike `listPayees` which is server-only, since the dashboard doesn't know which payeeId to ask for until a wallet connects client-side. Each row links to `/claim/[id]` for the payee's actual release/decline actions; nothing here moves money. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (103/103, 9 new in `payee-logic.test.ts`), `pnpm build` all green; confirmed the `/locks` rewrite returns real, already-created testnet locks for a known payeeId with the exact shape `listLocks` expects (`curl` against a local build with the real indexer URL); visually verified the pre-connect page renders cleanly with no console errors. Not independently verified: the post-wallet-connect render with real data, since driving a real wallet extension isn't automatable (same limitation already accepted for `/send`'s wallet step this session) |
| 2026-10-08 | `chore/retire-known-payees-fallback` | app | M3-26 (retired, status unchanged) | `kinlock-sdk`'s indexer (`M2-18`) is live on Railway (`indexer-production-705a.up.railway.app`, healthy, `lagLedgers: 0`), deployed by a teammate while `M3-26` was in flight. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` in Vercel (production and preview). Reverted `/send` and `/request` from `M3-26`'s interim `lib/payees/*` (chain-verified snapshot) back to the real `listPayees()`, and deleted that module: carrying two parallel payee sources going forward would be the dead-code / duplicate-abstraction AGENTS.md explicitly rules out, and the real indexer serves the identical three payees plus whatever gets registered next. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (94/94), `pnpm build`, then `pnpm start` locally against the real indexer URL confirmed `/send` and `/request` still list all three payees, this time genuinely through `M2-18`'s pipeline. `M2-18` itself is still `IN PROGRESS` in `kinlock-sdk`'s `ROADMAP.md` (daily backup schedule and a restore-vs-live comparison remain), not this repo's row to close |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/known-payees-chain-read` | app | DONE: M3-26 (new row) | `/send` and `/request` showed "can't be loaded" for every payee, since no indexer is deployed (`M2-18`, still `TODO`). Investigated whether `kinlock-registry`'s real `payees/` data could substitute, but it's empty (`.gitkeep` only) and the indexer's own registry-join (`kinlock-sdk/services/indexer/src/registry/sync.ts`) reads a local filesystem checkout, not something `kinlock-app` should fetch live or re-implement wholesale. Built a scoped interim source instead: `lib/payees/known.ts` is a committed snapshot of `kinlock-registry/fixtures/payees/` (the three fictional testnet fixtures), and `lib/payees/registry.ts` joins each one with a live chain read (`getPayee`, hard rule 3: chain is truth) before showing anything, verifying the on-chain `meta_hash` still matches this snapshot's hash of the full record, i.e. exactly the binding the real indexer enforces (same `canonicalize`/`sha256` algorithm, deliberately duplicated here as kinlock-sdk's indexer already duplicates it from kinlock-registry). `status` and `payout` are always the live on-chain values, never the snapshot's. Wired into `/send` and `/request` in place of the broken `listPayees()` call. While investigating, found all three fixtures were in fact already registered and `Active` on the real testnet contract from earlier work this session (not something this PR did); verified against the deployed contract directly (`stellar contract invoke ... get_payee`). Verified end to end with Playwright against the real local build (no indexer configured, matching production): both pages list all three payees, `/request` generates a real prefilled `/send` link, `/send`'s full review flow (schedule, take-back date, USD total, preflight) completes up to "Connect your wallet first" (the correct, by-design stopping point; actually signing needs a real wallet extension, out of scope for an automated check). Also installed the `stellar` CLI (Homebrew) and generated a throwaway testnet identity (`kinlock-fixture-attester`) while investigating, in case registration had been needed; turned out not to be. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (101/101, 7 new), `pnpm build` all green. Superseded once `M2-18` (real indexer) ships |
| 2026-10-08 | `fix/indexer-url-optional` | app | no row changes | Fix: owner reported `/send`, `/verify`, `/request` "not functioning" after the previous hotfix. Found the real root cause, one level deeper than that hotfix: `lib/config.ts`'s `PublicConfigSchema` required `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL`, but `@kinlock/sdk`'s own `KinlockConfig.indexerUrl` is typed `?: string` (optional) precisely so chain-only operations keep working without an indexer. Since `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` genuinely isn't set (no indexer deployed, `M2-18`), *every* `publicConfig()`/`kinlockConfig()` call was throwing before any RPC request was even attempted, breaking `verifyReceipt`, and by the same path `createLock`/`release`/`refund`/`decline`, anywhere they're called without an indexer-fetch guard already in front of them (`/verify`'s "Check" button made zero network requests; confirmed with Playwright). `next.config.ts`'s rewrites already treated a missing indexer URL as expected (`if (!indexer) return {...empty...}`), so this was a `kinlock-app`-only validation bug, not a real product gap. Changed `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` to `z.url().optional()` to match the SDK's own contract; added a regression test. Reproduced against the exact production condition before and after (dev server with the real indexer-less `.env.local`): before, `verifyReceipt` on `/verify` made 0 RPC requests and always hit the generic error; after, it makes a real `soroban-testnet.stellar.org` request and correctly resolves "Not valid / not found" for a made-up hash. `/send` and `/request` still correctly show "can't be loaded" for the payee list, since there's genuinely no indexer yet; that part is accurate, not a bug. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (94/94, new test added), `pnpm build`, plus the live repro above, before redeploying |
| 2026-10-08 | `fix/verify-publicconfig-crash` | app | M3-13 (no status change, still `DONE`) | Hotfix: `/verify` and `/r/[txHash]/[eventIndex]` were returning `500` in production (reported by the owner after the previous deploy). Root cause: `publicConfig()` validates the entire shared config, including `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL`, which isn't set in this Vercel project (no indexer deployed yet, `M2-18`); `/send`/`/request`/`/payee` happen to avoid calling it because they only reach it after a successful indexer fetch, but `useReceiptPage.ts`/`useVerifyForm.ts` called it unconditionally just to label the asset. Fixed by wrapping that call in a `try/catch`, degrading to no asset label (the existing fallback for a missing `lock`), same as `ReceiptResult.tsx` already does. Reproduced the exact failure locally first (dev server with `.env.local`'s real, indexer-less config, hitting `/verify` and `/r/...` directly: both 500 before the fix), then confirmed both return 200 after it, before redeploying. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (93/93), `pnpm build`, plus the live repro above |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/site-polish` | app | DONE: M3-25 (new row) | Added `app/icon.svg`/`app/apple-icon.png` (favicon and iOS icon, from the org's new lock mark in `kinlock-icon/`). Built `components/nav/SiteHeader.tsx`: a persistent header on every page, desktop nav (Send/Request/Verify) plus two separately-styled, separately-destined buttons (outline "Documentation" to `kinlock-org.github.io`, filled-neutral "GitHub" to `github.com/Kinlock-Org`), collapsing to a hamburger disclosure menu below `md` (closes on route change and Escape). Fixed the landing footer's stale docs link, which pointed at a raw GitHub markdown file instead of the real docs site. Installed the `emilkowalski/skills` `animate` skill and used it for the menu's entrance and a staggered hero fade/slide-up on the landing page (CSS-only, no new dependency, both gated under `prefers-reduced-motion`). Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (93/93), `pnpm build` all green; visually checked desktop, mobile closed/open, and dark mode with Playwright screenshots. Not done here: the GitHub org avatar itself (no API/CLI command sets it; recommended `kinlock-icon/icon-light-1024.png`, needs a human to upload via org settings) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/verified-payee-wording` | app | no row changes | Synced `AGENTS.md`/`docs/PRD.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` from `Kinlock-Org/.github` (`scripts/sync-docs.sh`), and updated `messages/en.json` (`app.tagline`, `pages.home.heroHeadline`/`heroSubtext`/`lockBody`/`sendersBody`, `pages.send.intro`): "a verified school or landlord" replaced with "a verified payee" everywhere it was used as a generic stand-in for the product's reach, rather than naming the two current MVP categories factually. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (92/92, including the inline-strings guard) all green. Canonical doc source edited in `.github` PR #23 |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/m3-13-receipt-verify` | app | DONE: M3-13 | Built `/r/[txHash]/[eventIndex]` and `/verify`, replacing their `PageStub`s. Both call the SDK's `verifyReceipt` (chain-authoritative tiered verification) and show "Valid"/"Not valid"; the "Payment to verified payee" headline (hard rule 7) renders only when `result.valid` is actually `true`. A separate `getLock` read is used purely to label the asset (code and issuer) since `VerifyReceiptResult.receipt` doesn't carry the token; falls back to an unlabeled amount rather than guessing when that lock is unavailable. New shared pieces: `lib/receipts/parse.ts` (pure link/hash parsing, unit-tested), `lib/receipts/receipt-text.ts` (message-key mapping), `components/receipts/ReceiptResult.tsx` (shared result view for both pages). Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (92/92 passed, including new `parse.test.ts`), `pnpm build` all green |

Set the 5 public, non-secret `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars from the real testnet deployment records (contract ID, USDC contract/issuer, RPC URL); left `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` unset since no indexer is deployed yet (`M2-18`, separate task) - indexer-dependent pages (`/send`, `/request`, `/payee`) degrade gracefully to their existing "can't load the list right now" state rather than breaking. GitHub auto-deploy-on-push could not be connected: the Vercel account's GitHub identity lacks admin/write on `Kinlock-Org/kinlock-app`, so future deploys need a manual `vercel --prod` (or fixing that GitHub App authorization) until resolved. Left `IN PROGRESS`, not `DONE`: the row formally depends on `M3-19` (E2E happy-path against testnet), which is still `TODO` |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/m3-04-landing-page` | app | DONE: M3-04 | Built the real landing page at `(marketing)/page.tsx` (hero, how-it-works, sender/payee split, principles, footer), replacing the `PageStub`. Added a site-wide testnet-safety banner (`common.testnetBanner`) to `layout.tsx` so it's visible on every page, not just the homepage. Added `Outfit` via `next/font/google` and a light/dark color-token system in `globals.css` (no new npm dependency). Content reviewed against hard rule 7 (honest receipt wording), no hard-coded country/currency, no fabricated traction/testimonials (none exist yet, so none are claimed), zero em-dashes. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (79/79 passed), `pnpm build` all green. Confirms the app needs a Node runtime (dynamic routes + proxy middleware), ruling out GitHub Pages for `M3-22`. Also installed `anthropics/skills` frontend-design and `Leonxlnx/taste-skill` design-taste-frontend as local dev tooling (gitignored, not committed) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/readme-refresh` | org | no row changes | Rewrote the org profile README: what Kinlock proves and what it does not, every repo including the docs hub and the conditional `kinlock-ramp`, the principles, the trust assumptions, and the every-PR `ROADMAP.md` rule. Folds in the pending verified-payee wording and the docs-hub links |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/docs-hub-link` (org) + `Kinlock-Org.github.io#1` | org | DONE: W-10 (expanded scope, no status change) | Repositioned the docs site repo as the org's documentation-issue hub, not just a static site: a documentation issue template, `area:contract`/`area:sdk`/`area:app`/`area:registry`/`area:site` labels for routing, a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining where a fix actually lands (that repo, if it needs code; the canonical `.github` docs, if it's architecture/PRD/ADRs; this repo, if it's the site itself), and a "File a documentation issue" section on the landing page. Linked from the org profile |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/live-app-link` (org) + direct push to new repo `Kinlock-Org.github.io` | org | DONE: W-10 (new row) | Published a hosted documentation site at `kinlock-org.github.io` (plain static HTML/CSS, no framework, no build step): a landing page explaining how the 4 repos fit together, plus one section per repo summarizing real facts (entry points, invariants, public API, testnet contract ID, test counts) with links out to the canonical docs for full depth, not a duplicate copy. Linked from the org profile README and every repo's own README. Pushed directly to `main` (new, empty repo, nothing to review against yet) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/m0-04-cost-model-template` | org | DONE: F-13 (found undone from an earlier pass). IN PROGRESS: M0-04 | Rebuilt on current `main` after `chore/f12-f16-governance` (#18) merged, to avoid a `ROADMAP.md` conflict. Added `docs/research/m0-04-cost-model-template.md`: the hop-by-hop cost structure `M0-04` asks for, seeded with cited public benchmarks (World Bank Remittance Prices Worldwide global average 6.49%; USDC on/off-ramp fee ranges; Stellar's ~$0.0001 on-chain fee) — explicitly illustrative, not Kinlock-specific; real numbers still need `M0-01` and `M0-05`, neither run yet. `M0-13` stays `TODO`, still blocked on this. Also closed `F-13` (label set): labels were actually created and verified across all 4 active repos in an earlier session pass, but the row was never flipped from `TODO` |
| 2026-10-08 | `feat/m3-24-country-agnostic-guard` | sdk | DONE: M3-24 | `M3-24` is a cross-cutting row ("all"); this PR plus a matching one in `kinlock-app` together complete it, so both mark it `DONE`. Added `packages/sdk/src/__tests__/country-agnostic.test.ts` and `services/indexer/test/country-agnostic.test.ts`: fails if `nigeria`, `naira`, `ngn`, or `lagos` (case-insensitive, whole-word) appears anywhere in source, excluding `*.test.ts` files. Grounded in `AGENTS.md`'s own quick-reference wording ("Don't assume Nigeria or naira"), not a general country/currency-word ban, since this project's fixtures and app deliberately exercise several real markets side by side; docs (`docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) are out of scope since they legitimately narrate the pre-v0.3 Nigeria-specific history. Runs via the existing `pnpm test` step already in both `packages/sdk` and `services/indexer`'s CI, so no workflow file changes were needed (same pattern `kinlock-app`'s `lib/i18n/inline-strings.test.ts` already uses for a different check). Verified the guard can actually fail, not just trivially pass: temporarily added a real violation to a file in each package, confirmed both caught it with the exact file named, reverted (`git diff` on both files is empty), confirmed a clean pass. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (165/165), `pnpm build` all green |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/readme-refresh` | sdk | no row changes | README was stale: it said the indexer is still being scaffolded, but it is built and running on testnet. Now documents the 16 public exports, the `bigint` and claim-link-fragment invariants, the list API routes, and the live indexer |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/m2-17-api-reference` | sdk | DONE: M2-17 | Added `packages/sdk/API.md`: every public export (client, preflight, receipts, links, hash, format, errors, types) documented with real signatures, params, return types, and a runnable usage example, read directly from the current `src/*.ts` source, not from memory. Linked from README. Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (123/123 passed) all green. Closes issue #25 (seeded under `W-02`) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/verified-payee-wording` | sdk | no row changes | Synced `AGENTS.md`/`docs/PRD.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` from `Kinlock-Org/.github` (`scripts/sync-docs.sh`): "a verified school or landlord" in the mission-statement-style sentences replaced with "a verified payee."

| 2026-10-08 | `docs/fix-entry-point-count` | contracts | no row changes | Corrected the README status banner: it claimed "All 20 entry points," but the single `#[contractimpl]` in `contracts/kinlock/src/lib.rs` exposes **18** (`__constructor` plus 17 callable). Counted directly from `lib.rs:29-136`; `admin.rs`/`registry.rs`/`vault.rs` hold internal implementations, not extra entry points. No other file in the workspace repeats the wrong number |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/verified-payee-wording` | contracts | no row changes | Synced `AGENTS.md`/`docs/PRD.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` from `Kinlock-Org/.github` (`scripts/sync-docs.sh`): "a verified school or landlord" in the mission-statement-style sentences replaced with "a verified payee."

| 2026-10-08 | `docs/m1-21-threat-model` | contracts | DONE: M1-21 | Expanded `SECURITY.md`'s threat model (was "draft pending"): a table linking each of the 10 property-tested invariants to exactly where `properties.rs::check_invariants` checks it and a representative unit test, plus a threats-to-controls table enriched with invariant numbers and the tests that verify each one. Cites real mutation-testing and independent-review evidence from the Changelog. Verified by actually running the suite: `cargo test --workspace` (107 unit tests, 1 property test, all green), `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean. Closes issue #17 (seeded under `W-02`) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/docs-site-link-fix` | contracts | no row changes (org row W-10 tracked in `.github`) | Re-added the hosted-docs-site link to README; a prior PR (#19) merged before its second commit adding this same link finished pushing, so it never landed the first time |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/live-app-link` | contracts | no row changes | Linked the live testnet app (`kinlock-app.vercel.app`, `M3-22`) from README; also set as the repo's GitHub "Website" field |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/readme-refresh` | registry | no row changes | README corrected: fixtures span three countries (KE, NG, PH), not two, and the real `payees/` and `attesters/` trees are still empty pending the `M0-17` supported-countries policy. Documents what CI enforces off-chain and the attester readiness script |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/link-doc-hub` | registry | no row changes (org row W-10 tracked in `.github`) | Linked `Kinlock-Org.github.io` (the org's documentation-issue hub) from README, with `area:registry` |

Canonical source edited in `.github` PR #23. Left `fixtures/README.md`'s "not real schools or landlords" unchanged (factual fixture disclaimer, not pitch copy) |
| 2026-10-08 | `docs/m1-26-attester-script` | registry | IN PROGRESS: M1-26 | Added `scripts/check-attester-readiness.ts` (`pnpm check-attester-readiness <payout-address>`): read-only checks for account existence, native XLM float, and an authorized USDC trustline with room, via direct ledger-entry reads (no new dependency). Verified against real testnet data, not just type-checked: ran it against the real testnet attester address and confirmed correct output (XLM float ✓, trustline ✗ as expected, since that address has none). Finalized `ATTESTER_CHECKLIST.md` to reference the script. Left `IN PROGRESS`, not `DONE`: the row's "runs end to end on testnet" criterion needs a real attester to complete it (`M0-06`), which hasn't happened. Progress toward issue #7 (seeded under `W-02`), not a full close |

| 2026-10-07 | `docs/scf-readiness-fixes` | app | no row changes (org rows W-09/F-12 tracked in `.github`) | Part of an org-wide SCF open-source readiness audit (see `.github` `docs/scf-readiness.md`): filled the unfilled `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` placeholder in `LICENSE` and added `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (GitHub's community-profile check was reporting `issue_template: false` despite templates existing) |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/readme-status-banner` | app | no row changes | README said "scaffold... features are not built," which is stale (send, claim, decline, and lock-detail flows work end to end on testnet). Corrected the status banner to match current progress; supports org-level `W-01` Wave-readiness |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-send-flow | app | M3-06 IN PROGRESS, M3-05 DONE | `/send`: verified payees (indexer list, server-side), prefill from a request link (M3-05 now pre-fills the form), schedule and take-back date checked like `create_lock`, USD with the USD-only rate note (DEC-10 open), wallet, preflight review (blocking failures stop; warnings need acknowledgement), lock via the wallet, claim link built and saved in this browser. Indexer list API served same-origin via rewrites (no CORS). Creating a lock through a real wallet still to verify |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-lock-page | app | M3-08 IN PROGRESS | `/locks/[id]`: lock and payee read from chain (`@kinlock/sdk` 0.3.0 `getPayee`); Refund shown only when the contract allows it (expired, payee Revoked, or Suspended past 14 days), otherwise when it becomes possible; only the sender's wallet can refund; receipt link after. Verified on testnet locks 4, 9, 10; refund through a real wallet pending (lock 10 expires 16:08 UTC). Docs synced (ADR-0030, AGENTS.md) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-decline (owner test) | app | M3-09 DONE, M3-10 DONE | Owner tested with Freighter on testnet as the payout account of lock 9: claimed payment 1 (tx 84e3a768…, 0.50 USDC to the payout) and declined the rest (tx 49bccbaf…, 0.50 USDC back to the sender); both receipts verify on chain and the indexer shows lock 9 Declined |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-decline | app | M3-10 IN PROGRESS | Claim page: payout account can return the unclaimed remainder to the sender, behind a confirmation step showing the exact amount and that it can't be undone; receipt link after. Logic unit-tested; the wallet-driven click-through needs a real wallet |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-claim-page | app | M3-09 IN PROGRESS | `/claim/[id]`: lock read from chain, reference checked against `ref_hash` in the browser (match, mismatch flagged, missing), tranche states mirroring the contract rule, wallet connect, release only for the payout account, receipt link after release. Verified on testnet lock 9 in a browser (no request carried the reference or salt); release through a real wallet still to verify |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-claim-links | app | M3-07 DONE | Claim links: generation (reference and salt only in the fragment), browser-only storage (localStorage, versioned key, corrupt data ignored), copy, remove with confirmation, export to a local file; listed on `/send`. Test checks the module has no network code; browser run: 20 requests, none carried the reference or salt |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-request-page | app | M3-05 IN PROGRESS | `/request`: payee picks a verified payee (list from the indexer, server-side), reference and up to 12 dated payments; the SDK builds the link in the browser. Says the link carries no authority and that the reference is visible to link holders. Done once `/send` pre-fills from it (M3-06) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app feat/app-sdk-config | app | M3-03 DONE | `lib/sdk.ts` is the single SDK entry point over `@kinlock/sdk` 0.2.0 (GitHub Release): config bound once, wallet adapter bridged to the SDK signer. `lib/config.ts` validates the public env (adds the USDC token contract ID; mainnet refused). Started while M2-02 is IN PROGRESS (local-network run pending), as with M2-06. Docs synced (ADR-0026..0029) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-app docs/sync-adr-0026 | app | DEC-03 amended (no row changes) | Sync docs from .github: ADR-0026 (packages as GitHub Release tarballs) and ADR-0023 marked superseded |
| 2026-10-07 | `chore/f16-branch-protection` | org | DONE: F-16 | Applied branch protection to `main` on all 5 repos: required status checks (repo-specific CI jobs, confirmed via recent PR check names so none are a path-filtered context that would never report), 1 required approving review + CODEOWNERS review, no force-push, no deletion. `.github` has no CI so only PR-required + no-force-push/delete there. This is a workflow change: merges now need an actual approval, not just green CI |
| 2026-10-07 | `chore/f12-teams` | org | DONE: F-12 | Created `maintainers` (abrcrmb, YazarAyobami, maintain access on all 5 repos), `contract-reviewers` (abrcrmb, YazarAyobami, maintain access on kinlock-contracts/sdk/app), and `attesters` (empty, push access on kinlock-registry so its `payees/**` rule resolves). Verified: `GET /repos/{repo}/codeowners/errors` returns zero errors on all 4 active repos (previously all failed with "Unknown owner"). Unblocks `F-16` (branch protection), `W-06`, `W-07` |
| 2026-10-07 | `chore/w02-seed-issues` | org | DONE: W-02 | Seeded 5 Wave-scoped issues from existing roadmap rows across all 4 active repos: `kinlock-app#15` (M3-17 accessibility), `kinlock-app#16` (M3-20 copy review), `kinlock-sdk#25` (M2-17 docs), `kinlock-registry#7` (M1-26 attester checklist), `kinlock-contracts#17` (M1-21 threat-model docs, docs-only). All drawn from `project_structure.md` §8's "safe for broad contribution" list; none touch fund logic, auth, or claim-link-fragment code. Unblocked by `kinlock-contracts` closing `M1-01` this same pass |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/scf-readiness` | org | DONE: W-09 (new row). IN PROGRESS: M0-14 | Audited Kinlock against the official SCF Build Award handbook (license, contributor/community guidelines, roadmap-deliverable clarity, technical-integration brief, differentiation). Fixed the unfilled `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` placeholder in every repo's `LICENSE` (→ "Kinlock Contributors," pending `DEC-13`) and added `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (GitHub's community-profile check was reporting `issue_template: false` despite the templates existing). Found `CODEOWNERS` is non-functional — it references `F-12` teams that don't exist yet. Could not verify "BarakahPay" as a real product via web search; found real comparables (RemitaPay, Circle Arc "Remit") instead. Full findings and "needs a human" list in `docs/scf-readiness.md` |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/m0-10-wave-rules` | org | DONE: M0-10. IN PROGRESS: W-01 | Added `docs/research/m0-10-wave-rules.md`: Drips Stellar Wave mechanics (issue sizing tiers, per-user/per-org repo-application limits that reset each cycle, KYC required to submit an application and to withdraw rewards), sourced from official docs. Confirms the existing plan to apply only the four active repos; flags KYC as a blocking prerequisite for a human to complete before `W-01` can reach `DONE`. One `wave` label created on `kinlock-contracts` toward `F-13`; the full label rollout across all four repos is prepared as a script for the maintainer to run (bulk label writes across repos were blocked for the agent) |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/m0-interview-materials` | org | IN PROGRESS: M0-01, M0-02, M0-03 | Added `docs/research/` with a sender interview script + note template (M0-01), payee interview script + note template (M0-02), and an attester conversation guide (M0-03), each mapped to `PRD.md` §8.2 pivot triggers and §10 assumptions, with log tables for findings. Scripts/templates only — no real interviews conducted yet, so rows stay `IN PROGRESS` pending actual notes and the themes summary |
| 2026-10-07 | .github docs/adr-sdk-getpayee | org | no row changes | ADR-0030: SDK gains `getPayee` (chain read) so money pages apply the full refund rule; AGENTS.md §8.2 lists it |

| 2026-10-07 | .github docs/adr-sdk-client | org | no row changes | ADR-0027: SDK contract functions take a config first and a wallet signer last; new types `KinlockConfig`, `Signer`; error codes `INVALID_INPUT`, `CONTRACT_ERROR`, `TX_FAILED` |
| 2026-10-07 | .github docs/reword-f11 | org | F-11 DONE (reworded, owner-approved) | F-11 reworded from npm to "package names and distribution"; done: `@kinlock/contract` 0.1.0 and `@kinlock/sdk` 0.1.0 released as GitHub Release tarballs and installed from their URLs. ADR-0026 corrected: pnpm lockfiles do not record an integrity hash for URL tarballs |
| 2026-10-07 | .github docs/adr-github-release-packages | org | DEC-03 amended | ADR-0026: distribute `@kinlock/contract` and `@kinlock/sdk` as GitHub Release tarballs (no npm account or token); supersedes ADR-0023 |

| 2026-10-07 | `docs/readme-status-banner` | sdk | no row changes | README said "scaffold... features are not built," which is stale (client, preflight, and receipts are implemented and released as v0.3.0). Corrected the status banner to match current progress; supports org-level `W-01` Wave-readiness |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-getpayee | sdk | no row changes | `getPayee` chain read (ADR-0030) for the sender lock page's refund rule; `@kinlock/sdk` 0.3.0 (release via tag `sdk-v0.3.0` after merge). Verified on testnet |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk test/sdk-localnet | sdk | M2-02 DONE | SDK client verified on the local quickstart network (fresh contract, local USDC, one payee: preflight, create, read, release, refused early refund, decline) and again on testnet; full refund verified on testnet (lock 4). Smoke script renamed `scripts/smoke.mjs` and parameterized for local or testnet |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk chore/sdk-0.2.0 | sdk | M2-17 IN PROGRESS (unchanged) | `@kinlock/sdk` 0.2.0: first release with the contract client, preflight and receipt verification (0.1.0 had them as stubs); signatures per ADR-0027..0029. Released via tag `sdk-v0.2.0` after merge |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-receipts | sdk | M2-06 DONE | SDK `verifyReceipt` (ADR-0029): tier 1 from RPC events (exact event, Kinlock contract, successful call, known schema version), tier 2 confirmed with `get_lock` after the indexer event lookup; reasons verified / not_found / mismatch / unverifiable. Real testnet release, decline and refund receipts verified; tampered references rejected |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-event-lookup | sdk | M2-06 IN PROGRESS | List API `GET /events/:txHash/:eventIndex`: which lock and tranche a receipt refers to, as a lookup aid for tier-2 receipt verification (proof stays on chain). Started while M2-02 is IN PROGRESS (local-network run pending), with owner approval |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-preflight | sdk | M2-05 DONE | SDK `preflight` (ADR-0028): sender balance, payee Active and payout trustline from chain (block); recent payout change and duplicate reference from the indexer (warn); `unknown` when a check can't complete. Unit test per check; testnet run with the live indexer passed all five |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-preflight-filters | sdk | M2-05 IN PROGRESS | List API filters for preflight: `GET /locks?payee_id=&ref_hash=` (duplicate reference, uses the existing (payee_id, ref_hash) index) and `GET /payees?payee_id=` (recent payout change) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk feat/sdk-client | sdk | M2-02 IN PROGRESS | SDK client over `@kinlock/contract` 0.1.0 (GitHub Release): `createLock`, `release`, `refund`, `decline` (build, simulate, wallet signs, submit) and chain-only `getLock`, with config and signer parameters (ADR-0027). Verified on testnet (create, read, release, refused early refund, decline); local-network run not done (no Docker on the dev machine) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk chore/sdk-github-release | sdk | M2-17 IN PROGRESS (unchanged), DEC-03 amended | `publish` workflow attaches the packed `@kinlock/sdk` tarball to a GitHub Release on `sdk-vX.Y.Z` (ADR-0026) instead of publishing to npm; no publish secret; ADR-0026 synced |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk docs/indexer-testnet-deployed | sdk | M2-18 IN PROGRESS (unchanged) | Indexer live on Railway testnet (https://indexer-production-705a.up.railway.app): caught up, registry join working, refund of lock 2 indexed within seconds. Postgres PITR enabled and a point-in-time restore into a new service succeeded; still open: daily schedule refused on the current plan, and the restored data not yet compared against live |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-sdk test/indexer-real-refund-fixture | sdk | no row changes | Indexer fixtures: add the real testnet `refunded` event for lock 2 (tx 7316fe69…) and replace the synthetic refund in the tests; replay now ends with lock 2 Refunded/Expired |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/m1-01-done` | contracts | DONE: M1-01 | Verified CI green on `main` (fmt/clippy/test/build) and `scripts/localnet.sh` + `scripts/localnet-setup.sh` both present and merged (`chore/localnet-setup`, PR #14). `M1-01` formally depends on gate `G1` (not yet passed) — closing this row now, ahead of G1, follows the same precedent as the rest of Phase 2's work, done ahead of G1 at the owner's request. This unblocks `W-02` (seed issues), which depended on `M1-01` |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/scf-readiness-fixes` | contracts | no row changes (org rows W-09/F-12 tracked in `.github`) | Part of an org-wide SCF open-source readiness audit (see `.github` `docs/scf-readiness.md`): filled the unfilled `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` placeholder in `LICENSE` and added `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (GitHub's community-profile check was reporting `issue_template: false` despite templates existing) |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/readme-status-banner` | contracts | no row changes | README said "scaffold... features are not built," which is stale (vault/registry entry points are implemented and tested). Corrected the status banner to match current progress; supports org-level `W-01` Wave-readiness |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-contracts chore/localnet-setup | contracts | M1-37 added, DONE | `scripts/localnet-setup.sh`: fresh local Kinlock in one command (local only; refuses other networks); verified on a fresh quickstart network, then the SDK smoke test passed with its env block (owner-approved new row). Docs synced (ADR-0028, ADR-0029) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-contracts docs/m1-18-done | contracts | M1-18 DONE | `@kinlock/contract` 0.1.0 released on tag `bindings-v0.1.0` (GitHub Release, ADR-0026); installs from its URL and the SDK consumes it (kinlock-sdk#15, testnet run passed). Docs synced (ADR-0026 correction, ADR-0027) |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-contracts chore/bindings-github-release | contracts | M1-18 IN PROGRESS (unchanged), DEC-03 amended | `bindings` workflow attaches the packed `@kinlock/contract` tarball to a GitHub Release on `bindings-vX.Y.Z` (ADR-0026) instead of publishing to npm; no publish secret; docs synced (ADR-0024..0026, AGENTS.md) |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/scf-readiness-fixes` | registry | no row changes (org rows W-09/F-12 tracked in `.github`) | Part of an org-wide SCF open-source readiness audit (see `.github` `docs/scf-readiness.md`): filled the unfilled `Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]` placeholder in `LICENSE` and added `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` (GitHub's community-profile check was reporting `issue_template: false` despite templates existing) |
| 2026-10-07 | `docs/readme-status-banner` | registry | no row changes | README said "scaffold... features are not built," which is stale (schema validation, hashing, and on-chain match checks are implemented with testnet fixtures). Corrected the status banner to match current progress; supports org-level `W-01` Wave-readiness |
| 2026-10-07 | kinlock-registry docs/sync-adr-0026 | registry | DEC-03 amended (no row changes) | Sync docs from .github: ADR-0026 (packages as GitHub Release tarballs) and ADR-0023 marked superseded |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/app-foundations` | app | DONE: M3-23. IN PROGRESS: M3-02, M3-14, M3-15 | Wallet adapter on Stellar Wallets Kit (browser-only); AssetLabel (code + issuer, full issuer for screen readers), AmountDisplay and DateTimeDisplay (UTC + local) on Intl with exact decimal strings; inline-string check and formatting tests across en/de/hi/ar/ja and USD/JPY/KWD. Claim pages get a per-request nonce CSP via proxy.ts (verified on a production build: all 8 Next.js scripts carry the nonce; the old static `script-src 'self'` would have blocked them). Fixed a date formatter that would have thrown |
| 2026-10-06 | `docs/sdk-public-api` | org | no row changes | ADR-0025: SDK public API gains amount conversion, reference hashing, and request-link helpers (owner-approved); AGENTS.md §8.2 updated |
| 2026-10-06 | `docs/adr-ref-hash` | org | no row changes | ADR-0024: exact reference-hash and claim-link format (16-byte base64url salt; SHA-256 of NFC-trimmed UTF-8 reference followed by salt bytes; fragment-only claim links), as implemented in kinlock-sdk |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/license-and-publishing` | org | DONE: F-10. IN PROGRESS: F-11. DEC-02, DEC-03 resolved | Apache-2.0 for every repo (ADR-0022, `LICENSE` + template); TypeScript packages publish to npm under `@kinlock` from CI on tag (ADR-0023). F-11 waits on an owner creating the npm org and the `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Canonical roadmap re-merged from all repos (picks up M2-01, M3-01). `sync-docs.sh --check` now also fails on ADRs a repo has that the canonical copy lacks (it missed that drift before) |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-deploy | sdk | M2-18 IN PROGRESS | Indexer container (Dockerfile, registry clone at start, migrations before start), `railway.json`, CI job that builds the image and applies migrations against Postgres, Railway runbook with backup and restore-test steps. Not yet deployed: needs the Railway project and variables |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-registry-join | sdk | M2-13 DONE, M2-19 DONE | Registry join: payee name, city, country, local currency and attester handle come from a registry checkout (`REGISTRY_DIR`), shown only when the file is hash-bound to the on-chain registration (payee_id = sha256(slug), meta_hash = sha256(canonical file)); attester handle only when its address matches on-chain; `/payees?country=` filters on joined data; migration 0001 adds `payees.attester_handle` |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-list-api | sdk | M2-12 DONE | List API: `/locks` (sender, payee, state filters; paging), `/locks/:id` with tranches, `/payees` (category, country, text filters; paging), `/health` with ledger lag (503 when lagging or tip unknown); every response labeled `source: "indexer"` with the ledger it reflects; typed request/response contract in `api/schemas.ts`. Started while M2-10 is IN PROGRESS (only its mixed-version test remains), with owner approval |
| 2026-10-06 | kinlock-sdk feat/indexer-ingest | sdk | M2-08 DONE, M2-09 DONE, M2-10 IN PROGRESS, M2-11 DONE, M2-14 IN PROGRESS | Indexer core: RPC client with failover and Zod checks, cursor-based ingest that commits events, effects and cursor in one transaction and stops on gaps or unknown events, handlers for all 7 events (schema_version 1), initial migration, PGlite tests replaying 11 recorded testnet events. Mixed-version fixtures wait for a second schema_version |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/sdk-publish` | sdk | IN PROGRESS: M2-17 | `@kinlock/sdk` 0.1.0 made publishable (exports map, `dist/` only, public access) and a tag-triggered publish workflow (`sdk-vX.Y.Z`, checks + npm provenance). Verified by installing the packed tarball into a blank project and calling it. Not yet published: waits on `NPM_TOKEN` (F-11) |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/sdk-public-api` | sdk | no row changes | Public API gains `toBaseUnits`, `fromBaseUnits`, `generateSalt`, `computeRefHash`, `buildRequestLink`, `parseRequestLink` (owner-approved, ADR-0025); the pinned export test now lists 15 functions. AGENTS.md and docs synced |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/sdk-format-hash-links` | sdk | DONE: M2-03, M2-04, M2-07 | Exact amount conversion (never rounds); `ref_hash` = SHA-256(UTF-8(NFC-trimmed reference) ‖ 16 random salt bytes) (ADR-0024); claim links carry reference and salt only in the URL fragment; request-link helpers built but not exported (public API list, F-19). 49 tests incl. an independent hash check and a no-logging test; 4 mutation checks caught |
| 2026-10-06 | `fix/bindings-errors-sdk17` | contracts | no row changes (M1-18 stays IN PROGRESS) | Every contract error variant now has a doc comment (`Name: explanation`); stellar-sdk takes client error messages from these, so they were empty before. Bindings pinned to `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 17.2.1 (same as kinlock-sdk). Verified live on testnet: errors decode as e.g. "PayeeNotFound: no payee is registered with this ID." |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/ts-bindings` | contracts | IN PROGRESS: M1-18 | Generated TypeScript bindings committed as `@kinlock/contract` 0.1.0; `gen-bindings.sh` sets package metadata; tag-triggered publish workflow (`bindings-vX.Y.Z`, npm provenance) and a CI check that committed bindings match a fresh generation. Not yet published: waits on the npm org and `NPM_TOKEN` (F-11) |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/registry-validation` | registry | DONE: M1-24, M1-25, M1-27, M1-29 | Registry validation (Ajv schemas, canonical formatting, supported country, attester scope, folder match, unique slug, real ISO codes) with 16 failing-case tests; `hash` and `check-onchain` tools. Three fictional fixture payees (KE, NG, PH; School and Rent) with funded testnet payouts holding authorized USDC trustlines, registered on testnet by the attester; `check-onchain` confirms all three match and catches a mismatch. Real `supported-countries.json` unchanged (empty) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/license-and-publishing` | org | DONE: F-10. IN PROGRESS: F-11. DEC-02, DEC-03 resolved | Apache-2.0 for every repo (ADR-0022, `LICENSE` + template); TypeScript packages publish to npm under `@kinlock` from CI on tag (ADR-0023). F-11 waits on an owner creating the npm org and the `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Canonical roadmap re-merged from all repos (picks up M2-01, M3-01) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/ts-tooling` | sdk | DONE: M2-01. DEC-22, DEC-23 resolved (ADR-0021) | Biome (lint + format), Vitest, and tsx added; CI now runs lint, typecheck, test, and build. Tests pin the SDK's public API to the approved list and the contract's enum order, and check the indexer refuses bad config |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/roadmap-sync` (lockfile) | sdk | no row changes (M2-01 stays IN PROGRESS: lint and test tooling pending DEC-22) | Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` for the dependency versions approved by the owner on 2026-10-06, so CI's frozen install works; typecheck and build pass |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/ts-tooling` | app | DONE: M3-01. DEC-22, DEC-23 resolved (ADR-0021) | Biome (lint + format) and Vitest added; CI now runs lint, typecheck, test, and build. Tests keep the receipt wording exactly "Payment to verified payee", ban overclaiming wording, and check every message key resolves. M3-23 stays IN PROGRESS (inline-string lint and multi-locale formatting tests) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/roadmap-sync` (lockfile) | app | no row changes (M3-01 stays IN PROGRESS: lint and test tooling pending DEC-22) | Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` for the dependency versions approved by the owner on 2026-10-06, so CI's frozen install works; typecheck and build pass |
| 2026-10-06 | `docs/adr-ts-tooling` | org | DEC-22, DEC-23 resolved (no row changes) | ADR-0021: Biome, Vitest, tsx, Ajv + ajv-formats; the app keeps its built-in i18n helper |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/roadmap-merge` | org | DONE: F-08, F-14, F-15, F-17, W-03 | Added `scripts/roadmap-merge` (three-way merge against the last merged copy; conflicts reported, never guessed) and merged every repo's ROADMAP.md into the canonical copy, then synced it to all repos. Verified: org exists with an owner; `docs-in-sync` and `roadmap-check` fail and pass correctly; templates and the CONTRIBUTING rule are in every repo. F-09 stays IN PROGRESS (code of conduct is still a draft) |
| 2026-10-06 | `chore/testnet-multisig-deploy` | contracts | DONE: M1-19 | Testnet contract `CCSHDQFRYFC3AHV5NE6ULQW6X2CMG5RPANBORDXJGSUD6UKECASJQBRI` with a 2-of-3 multisig admin (verified: one signature rejected `TxBadAuth`, two accepted), test attester added, Circle testnet USDC allowlisted. Adds `scripts/multisig-invoke.sh` and `deployments/testnet-setup.md`; vendored docs resynced (ADR-0020). Supersedes the single-key contract `CDIPDHSA…TLYL` |
| 2026-10-06 | `feat/deploy-script` | contracts | DONE: M1-17 | `scripts/deploy.sh` (testnet/local, guarded mainnet, dry run, uploaded-hash check) and `scripts/gen-deployments-md.sh`. Deployed to testnet: `CDIPDHSAKP2MNANLYV6VRWVTWFJH3PQRHBRDBVMYNMRYKSR66JVPTLYL`, single-key admin `kinlock-testnet-deployer` (multisig admin, attesters, and testnet USDC remain M1-19) |
| 2026-10-06 | `test/close-m1-11-m1-12` | contracts | DONE: M1-11, M1-12, M1-32 | Removed never-returned errors `AlreadyInitialized` (1) and `TrancheSumMismatch` (27), codes retired; every remaining error variant is now covered by a test. Upgrade tested with the real compiled WASM (admin auth asserted, state survives, intruder fails). CI installs stellar-cli 27.0.0 (checksum-verified) and builds the WASM before clippy and tests |
| 2026-10-06 | `test/property-invariants` | contracts | DONE: M1-14, M1-10 | Property tests for invariants 1–10: random sequences (create, release, refund, decline, status and payout changes, time jumps and exact boundaries, pause, allowlist and roster changes, frozen accounts) check every invariant after every step, and that release/refund/decline succeed exactly when the spec allows. Green over 512 cases; catches 13–14 of 14 injected vault bugs per 64-case run. Started before M1-11 was DONE, at the owner's request |
| 2026-10-05 | `fix/max-lock-duration` | contracts | DONE: M1-33. DEC-07 resolved | `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` = 149 days: testnet `max_entry_ttl` is 3,110,400 ledgers and a contract can extend to one ledger less, so 150 + 30-day grace doesn't fit. Tests now run with the real network limit |
| 2026-10-05 | `feat/vault` | contracts | DONE: M1-03, M1-04, M1-05, M1-06, M1-07, M1-08, M1-13, M1-31. IN PROGRESS: M1-09, M1-10, M1-11, M0-08. Added: M1-33, M1-34, M1-35, M1-36 | Vault: `create_lock`, `release`, `refund`, `decline`, `bump_lock`, `get_lock`; lock and payee TTL kept to `expires_at + TTL_GRACE` (`LockTtlTooLong` otherwise); `InvalidPayout`; `set_caps` sanity; storage version. 103 tests; 19 mutation checks caught; independent review: no critical/high. Testnet `max_entry_ttl` read as 3,110,400 ledgers (M0-08, M1-33). Vendored `docs/adr/` resynced with ADR-0018 and ADR-0019 |
| 2026-10-05 | `feat/admin-registry` | contracts | IN PROGRESS: M1-03, M1-04, M1-12 (M1-02 stays IN PROGRESS). Added: M1-31, M1-32 | Admin functions (constructor replaces `init`), payee registry (`register_payee`, `set_status`, `update_payout`, `get_payee`), TTL extension for long-lived entries, new errors `InvalidCap`, `PayoutUnchanged`, `PayeeRevoked`; 42 unit, auth, event, and TTL tests; independent review findings addressed. Started ahead of G1 at the owner's request |
| 2026-10-05 | `docs/adr-vault` | org | DEC-07 resolved (no row changes) | ADR-0020: vault validation and storage-lifetime rules (LockTtlTooLong, InvalidPayout, set_caps sanity, storage version); `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` = 149 days in ARCHITECTURE, ESSENTIALS, and PRD |
| 2026-10-05 | `docs/adr-admin-registry` | org | no row changes | ADR-0018 (constructor initialization, explicit caller parameters) and ADR-0019 (removed attesters lose payee powers), recording decisions approved for `kinlock-contracts` `feat/admin-registry`. Doc text updates remain under F-19 |
| 2026-10-05 | scaffold (requested by owner; branch `chore/scaffold` in each repo, uncommitted) | all | IN PROGRESS: F-09, F-14, F-15, F-17, W-03, M1-01, M1-02, M1-24, M1-29, M2-01, M2-11, M3-01, M3-23. Added: F-19, M1-30, DEC-22, DEC-23 | Scaffolded org `.github` (docs, 16 ADRs + proposed ADR-0017, templates, `sync-docs.sh`, `roadmap-progress`) and the contracts, registry, sdk, and app repos with data models and stubs. Done ahead of G1 at the owner's request. `kinlock-ramp` left untouched (conditional). Counts refreshed with `scripts/roadmap-progress` |
| 2026-10-05 | scope change (requested by owner) | org | Edited: M0-01, M0-02, M0-05, M0-07, M1-27, M3-06, M3-16, H-11, D-03, D-14, DEC-10, DEC-11, §1 items 5 and 9. Added: M0-16, M0-17, M1-29, M2-19, M3-23, M3-24, H-25, H-26, P-07, L-08, D-16, DEC-19..21 | Product generalized from "abroad to Nigeria" to worldwide (market-by-market launch). Docs bumped to v0.3; country-agnostic-core rule added to `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md`. §1 edited with the owner's approval |
| 2026-10-05 | initial | org | F-01..F-07 | Roadmap created; docs v0.2 baseline recorded; update rule added to `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `project_structure.md`, `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` |
